Number of HIV cases increasing among young: Expert,2018-12-01,NAGPUR,"News,City News,Nagpur News","NAGPUR: While incidence of HIV has reduced all over the world, terminally marginalized population remains largely undiagnosed.This year, theme for World Aids Day is ‘Know Your (HIV) Status’. Dr Milind Bhrushundi of Central India Institute of Infectious Diseases and Research Nagpur, said, “We are targeting those who have not been tested. Since symptoms of HIV are dormant for over five years, many are not aware if they have HIV, and the only way for them is to get tested. We need to reach out to high risk population — most of whom are homosexuals and transgenders.”It is also worrisome to note instances of HIV is increasing in the age group of 15-24 years as people are more concerned about pregnancy than the child. Emergency contraceptive pills and the Internet have proven to be a problem. Also, there have been cases in which people on second line of drugs don’t take medications seriously. Alcoholism and drug abuse are significant factors, he added.A 90-90-90 programme by UNAIDS aims that by 2030, there should be a 90% reduction in the number of patients, 90% reduction in new cases and 90% less deaths. Targeted intervention projects to treat those at high risk are need of the hour.Former senior medical officer at ART centre of GMC stated that even today, the same four causes are responsible for HIV patients as those many years ago — unprotected sex and multiple sex partners , parent to child transmission, blood transfusion and unsterilized needles.“New technology is not yet available in government hospitals. Since HIV antigen takes about six months to develop, an anti-body test does not identify the antigen. And if the affected person donates blood within those six months, the antigen will be passed to the blood banks,” she said, adding that about 20 lakh patients have been taking medicine free of cost at GMC. “Earlier, 1000 new cases were identified every month, but they have now reduced to under 100,” she added.“Positive cases of HIV have reduced due to expansion of our units and increase in awareness. There has been a rise in people taking the test and antenatal check-up as well. We have started mobile vans and even issued bus passes for patients, apart from giving free treatment and drugs,” said Tanuja Fale, Programme Manager, District Aids Prevention and Control Unit."
Tamarind seeds has antiviral properties and can potentially be used to develop antiviral medication for chikungunya,2018-11-14,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: Tamarind seeds has antiviral properties and can potentially be used to develop antiviral medication for chikungunya, finds IIT, Roorkee researchers. During the research, antiviral activity of the tamarind seed lectin has been shown by techniques such as luciferase-based assay, plaque reduction assay and real-time PCR. Not only did the chikungunya virus lose 64% of is infectivity on treatment with the lectin, but the levels of viral RNA in the cells were also found to reduce to nearly 45%.The findings have recently been published in the Elsevier journal, Virology. The research group at IIT Roorkee has filed a patent for an antiviral composition containing this tamarind antiviral protein. The researchers are now developing tamarind-based therapeutic agents for chikungunya.Alphaviruses cause mild to severe viral diseases in human beings and animals and are usually transmitted by mosquitoes. The chikungunya virus is an alphavirus that causes high fever and severe joint pain.Professors Shailly Tomar and Pravindra Kumar from the Department of Biotechnology, have shown that a protein found in tamarind seeds has antiviral properties.“Antiviral drugs and vaccines against most alphaviruses, including chikungunya are still not available in the market, and preventive measures are currently the only route to managing diseases caused by such viruses,” said Tomar, on the importance of developing antiviral therapeutics.Chikungunya and other alphaviruses are made of a single strand of RNA that is enveloped in a capsule. The outmost layer of capsule consists of glycoproteins having glycans, a form of sugar. Through these sugar moieties viruses attach to the host cell receptors and enter the cells, causing infections.An antiviral drug that is able to block the interaction of alphaviruses with the host cell and thus should inhibit the virus. In biological systems, antibodies bind to the viral surface glycans (sugar) and glycoproteins and prevent entry of the virus into the host cells. Thus, research on developing antiviral drugs have largely focused on developing sugar-binding molecules that can mimic the action of biological antibodies.Lectin, a diverse group of proteins derived from plant sources, are known to bind to glycan sugars. The use of lectin as antiviral has been extensively studied for a range of viruses, including the HIV and HPV. Tomar and Kumar have shown that a lectin derived from tamarind seeds bind to glycans/ sugar molecules having N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) on the capsule of viruses, thereby preventing the entry of the virus into the host cells. Chikungunya glycoproteins have NAG, which makes the tamarind-derived lectin a promising agent against this virus.“Tamarind is known for various medicinal properties in India and is an excellent Ayurvedic food. The fruits, seeds, leaves and roots bark of the tamarind tree have been used to treat abdominal pain, diarrhoea and dysentery, bacterial infections and parasitic infestations, wounds, constipation and inflammation,” said the researchers. They have isolated lectin from tamarind seeds using chromatography and have studied the binding of the lectin molecules to the glycan in the viral capsule by a process called Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). Antiviral activity of the tamarind seed lectin has been shown by techniques such as luciferase-based assay, plaque reduction assay and real-time PCR. Not only did the chikungunya virus lose 64% of is infectivity on treatment with the lectin, but the levels of viral RNA in the cells were also found to reduce to nearly 45%.“This study has, for the first time, evaluated the antiviral use of tamarind seed-derived lectin having specificity for NAG and assessed its ability to block the entry step of the virus,” said Tomar."

Children’s home guard not guilty of sodomising HIV+ boy,2018-11-15,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Delhi News,Crime","NEW DELHI: Terming it a “classic” and “unsolved” mystery , the Delhi high court acquitted a security guard of a children’s home of the charge of repeatedly sodomising minor orphan boy who is HIV positive Justice C Hari Shankar reversed the trial court’s verdict awarding 10-year jail to the accused, saying it would be a ""travesty of justice"" to convict him of having committed such an “unsolved” crime. The high court, in its 69-page judgement, noted that while the child was HIV positive, accused Amardeep Kujur tested negative and noted that there were allegations that the child was sexually assaulted multiple times. It underlined that the possibility of non-transmission of the HIV virus to the accused would be remote and disagreed with the trial court’s finding that it was not necessary that the HIV virus would, in every case of sexual contact, be transmitted from partner to partner.Justice Shankar observed that the trial judge “ignored the above two facts, apparent from the evidence, i.e., firstly, that the child had suffered mucosal tears in the private parts and, secondly, that the man was alleged to have repeatedly sexually assaulted the child. Sexual contact is, it is well known, the primary mode by which HIV virus is transmitted.”In the judgement, the high court said the mystery of how the assaulter entered the room where the minor was sleeping, and sodomised him day after day, remained unanswered. “The situation, in the present case, remains a classic, and unsolved ‘locked room mystery’, even while the man stands convicted and sentenced (by the trial court). This is entirely impermissible in law,” HC noted.While the child's father was in jail, his mother had died of HIV and, as there was not nobody to look after him, he was sent to the children home for boys."
Activists irked by RCEP talks over pharma patents,2018-11-15,MUMBAI,"News,BUSINESS NEWS,India Business News","MUMBAI: Public health activists and patient groups have raised serious concerns over intellectual property (IP) provisions in the ongoing negotiations of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), charging Japan and South Korea of pushing a TRIPS-plus regime that would expand and extend monopolies for pharma MNCs, and undermine generic competition. This, in effect, would impact generic competition that is critical for lowering medicines’ prices, and hence keep them unaffordable for millions of patients across the developing world.By resisting constant pressure in the past and safeguarding its generic industry, India — often referred to as ‘a pharmacy of the developing world’, has become a leading global supplier of affordablegeneric medicines for HIV, TB, malaria and other infectious diseases.In a letter to Union commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu , activists say if the proposed provisions are accepted, it will be a major setback for public health safeguards under Indian patent laws. Japan and South Korea reportedly continue to push India and Asean member states to agree to IP provisions that expand and introduce new monopolies for pharmaceutical corporations, including data exclusivity, patent term extension and stringent IP enforcement.These provisions are referred to as TRIPS-plus, and go beyond India’s obligations under the World Trade Organization’s agreement on the Trade Related Aspect of Intellectual Property Rights, or TRIPS, according to industry experts."
Zika scare: MP violates blood donation norms,2018-11-16,BHOPAL,"News,City News,Bhopal News,Civic Issues","BHOPAL: Confusion prevails over guidelines framed to check the spread of Zika infection and blood donation. The Union government’s national blood transfusion council (NBTC) guidelines state to disqualify donation of blood by a Zika-infected person at least for four months. On the other hand, MP is permitting blood donation after four weeks only.The vector-borne disease has spread its tentacles to one more district— Hardataking the total number of affected districts to eight.On Thursday, 32 samples were tested out of which three were found positive for Zika fever and all positive cases were from Bhopal.“Those, who have been diagnosed for Zika fever, should not be allowed to donate blood for at least one month and those who visited the places affected by Zika should also refrain from blood donation for about two weeks,” said MP health department joint director Dr Rakesh Mushi. He said it to be from an MP health department Zika alert circular issued in 2016.NBTC’s donor selection, referral guidelines and circular issued on October 2017 directed blood banks across the country not to accept blood from people, who have visited Zika-affected or Zikainfected. It states: “In case of Zika infection, defer for four months following recovery. In case of history of travel to endemic Zika virus outbreak zone, the same protocol is followed.”Zika virus is a new challenge for blood transfusion, according to a study published in The Lancet.Unlike other vector-borne ailment like dengue and chikungunya , Zika virus can be spread by blood transfusion and sexual intercourse.With over 100 Zika cases already diagnosed in MP, blood transfusion and possible transmission of Zika is a clear and presents threat, said experts. “As per the protocol, we do not accept a donor, with a history of fever and other recent sickness,” said Gandhi Medical College blood bank in-charge, Dr U M Sharma.The post-surveillance programmes are important to detect Zika virus infections among the blood donors, as surveillance can only detect blood donors with the disease.Currently, a mandatory check for a blood donor does not include Zika infection. Blood donors are checked for hepatitis B , hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS, syphilis and malaria"

'HIV is a sin that needs to be tackled by God's rule',2018-11-19,AIZAWL,"News,City News,Guwahati News","AIZAWL: Mizoram has the highest prevalence of HIV among adults in the country. But the Zoram Thar or New Mizoram, a spiritual group fielding candidates for the Mizoram polls headed by evangelist-turned politician Reverend Zaichhawna Hlawndo has a different take on the problem and its solution.Hlawndo said that the problem of HIV in Mizoram is a sin that can only be tackled when God’s rule is established.""I am telling people that when people disobey God, they commit sins. You and I can do nothing to tackle the problem of HIV. But only God can eliminate the menace of HIV. For this to happen, our duty is to make sure that people who will rule are godly men and women,” saidHlawndo, who returned from UK in 2017 and joined the electoral fray as a 'divine call'.He added that the path of evils brings down the afflictions like HIV.According to National AIDS Control Organisation’s 2017 estimation, Mizoram at 2.04 per cent has the highest HIV prevalence rate in the country, followed by Manipur (1.43 per cent) and Nagaland (1.15 per cent). At the national level, the prevalence rate is 0.22 per cent and it is said to be declining.Mizoram’s population is about 11 lakh and about 18,081 were found to be HIV positive between October 1990 and August this year. In Mizoram, the trend of HIV positive cases is on the rise.""Therefore if we have to make things right, our minds and hearts have to be right. I mean we have to shun the path of evil and embrace the path of God,"" Hlawndo said, adding that his party is for bringing in moral transformation, rather than material reforms.Hlawndo’s party has fielded 24 candidates for the 40-member assembly polls on November 28. Hlawndo is contesting from two seats--- in Serchhip he is pitted against chief minister Lal Thanhawla and in Aizawl West-I.He prefers to call his party candidates including himself as 'apostles' of ""moral transformation"" for Mizoram. Among the 24 candidates who are contesting as Independents, there are three women, including Hlawndo's two daughters.In his meetings, Hlawndo says his part's intention is not to be the rulers, but servants of God. ""God is going to make the nation. We will serve as his servants,"" he said. As an evangelist, Hlawndo has a strong followers in the Christian-majority state.If Hlawndo has the theological solution to the problem of HIV, the ruling Congress and the opposition Mizo National Front (MNF) have virtually failed to make it a major health issue in the current election.""Our manifesto focuses on the health issues in a comprehensive way which also includes HIV. If we come to power, the problem of HIV will be dealt with in an effective way,"" Congress spokesperson, Lallian Chhunga said.MNF chief and party's chief ministerial candidate, Zoramthanga said it was Congress government’s failure to check the spread of HIV.

Controlling HIV a social duty: Minister,2018-12-01,Thiruvananthapuram,"News,City News,Thiruvananthapuram News","Thiruvananthapuram: Steps to control HIV virus should be seen as a social responsibility, said health minister K K Shailaja. “We have already initiated a project which will hopefully control the number of HIV patients,” said the minister while inaugurating the World Aids Day observance here on Saturday.Referring to a recent report on the Nipah virus outbreak in May-June which differed on the number of deaths due to the infection from the official toll, the minister said there was no confusion. “Kerala was the only state which successfully defended the outbreak. Those who have read the medical report on Nipah would clearly understand that statistics presented by the government was accurate.”As per the official records, there are only 18 confirmed cases including the index case and 16 deaths. Recently, there was a confusion on the toll following the publication of a research paper in an international journal which also included four probable cases which were not confirmed by tests.Shailaja praised the efforts of the health department who successfully found the virus by the time the second death was reported. “We identified the virus and initiated effective countermeasures which proved vital in controlling the outbreak. Patients who showed identical symptoms to the deceased were checked and their blood samples collected. Of the 18, who showed similar symptoms initially, 16 died but we were able to save two people.” She further added that there was no point in saying that sending samples prior to confirming the disease would have made significant changes. “Even the sample taken from a person, who lost four members to the virus, showed negative. So, saying things would’ve been different if we had sent in the samples earlier is pointless,” she argued.MLA V S Sivakumar presided over the ceremony. Aids Control Society project director R Ramesh, district control officer Sindhu and University College principal J Anilkumar also spoke."

"Tattoo’s cool, say these youngsters",2018-12-02,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Delhi News","NEW DELHI: Young Indians are increasingly wearing their faith on their sleeves — or rather their skin. Nothing could be a better indicator of this than the people crowding the Heartwork Tattoo Festival 2018 being held at DLF Mall in Saket . The favoured themes at the inking fest, apart, of course, from the usual of the beloved’s name, are references from Hindu mythologies and Sanskrit mantras.With pop culture an aspirational obsession among the Indian youth, the tattoo festival has aimed big, bringing in 130 artists, including 38 from abroad, among them Paul Booth of New York, the man who inked WWE’s hugely popular wrestler Undertaker.Booth charges customers $500, or around Rs 35,000, per hour. But there is a wider range for those seeking to inscribe their bodies. “The minimum one needs to spend is around Rs 2,000, though there is no stopping them if they want to go as high as Rs 5 lakh for a full body tattoo,” grins Lokesh Verma, founding organiser of the event, which is in its fourth edition this year. Verma, who started his tattoo studio in Delhi in 2003, expects at least 10,000 enthusiasts to come during the three-day event ending on Sunday. Last year, the number of visitors was 6,000.“When I started, I used to do five tattoos in a month. In 2018, I get 10 clients a day,” says Verma. “I have often heard people saying getting inked is filled with risks of contracting HIV, but that’s not totally correct. Events like this give a clearer picture of the industry.”Sameer Patange, in the industry for 18 years now, feels that the eagerness to get a tat has increased with pop culture catching on in the country and with the exposure to social media. “People want to look fashionable,” smiles Patange. “The misconception that a person cannot donate blood if he or she gets tattooed is sometimes a deterrent to hopefuls, but the truth is one can donate blood after six months of the inking.”The youngsters find their role models in celebrities and sports idols with their bodies flaunting skin art. As Jai, a young student at the festival, enthuses, “Media coverage of celebrities getting inked makes a strong impression on the youth, that is why students like me want to get tattoos.”But tats aren’t without risks, though these can be minimal in proper studios. “Tattoo making is a combination of art and science, and it is like surgery,” explains Vikas Malani, co-founder of Body Canvas Tattoos which has its branches in Mumbai, Delhi and London. “Hygiene is very important, and sadly some tattooists compromise on this aspect.” Malani uses, and says others must too, disposable gloves and syringes and advises the client on the aftercare.Shivam, who was getting a Japanese design on his skin, said he loved tattoos and has several done. “This is the first time I am getting inked in India, encouraged by the presence of world-class artists,” he said. Indeed, Malani said people often prefer to get tattoos when abroad. “We lack a tattoo friendly atmosphere in India,” he said, “and I wish the government would have a licensing system to make the profession safer and more respectable.”Ifyrefini, an inker from Australia, was impressed by the designs in India, which he said were different from those across the Asia Pacific. Booth, the New Yorker, also expressed his happiness that the “industry has grown since I was in India three years ago”. Booth, however, had a message for the artists. “My message to people who want to take up tattooing as a profession is for them to first learn the art properly before trying to become an instant rock star.”"

It is known to affect about 1 in 6 couples, and various studies conducted have revealed that about 1 in every 3 cases are due to fertility issues in male partner. Hence male fertility in current times is an alarming issue that needs to be given utmost attention., tells about male infertility.This is when a man has a reduced chance of making his female partner pregnant. The condition is based on the quality of his sperm cells. The below-mentioned factors of semen have a major impact on fertility:: An imperative characteristic of semen is the concentration of sperms and their total number, in a given amount of ejaculate.: An indispensable function of healthy sperm cells is their capacity to swim. It is usually measured as the fraction of mobile sperm cells in a semen sample.Infertility problems can have many causes and may be determined by factors like genetics, overall health, sickness and nutritional contaminants. Moreover, a healthy lifestyle and appropriate diet are of prime importance. Some nutrients and diets are linked to superior fertility.Factors that may cause male infertilityMale infertility is generally due to snags that affect either production or transportation of sperm. About two-thirds of infertile men face a problem with producing sperm. Either low numbers of sperm are produced or the sperms are functionally poor. The blockage of the Vas deference is seen in about 1 in 5 infertile men and is responsible for causing either complete or partial lack of sperm in semen.Infertility issues in men can also arise due to hereditary causes, infections, hormone imbalance, torsions (means the twisting of testes in the scrotum), and the problem of varicocele or varicose veins of the testes, certain medications and damage caused by radiation. Apart from these; some less known causes of infertility are: sexual dysfunction and anti-sperm antibodies may not cause any problem. Mentioned below are a couple of clinical terms that are used in relation to male factor infertility.- Defines complete lack of sperm in the ejaculate. About 2 percent of the total male population is affected by this condition. It may be caused either due to lack of production of a sperms or due to a hindrance in the seminal ducts .- Defines incapability to uphold an erection.- The presence of less than twenty millions of total sperm per ml of ejaculate.- Poorly moving capacity of sperm.- A genetic condition where a bit of genetic material is missing from the Y chromosome that is absent or partly missing. This can lead to low count of sperms .- It is an unusual enlargement of the veins that drain the deoxygenated blood from the testes. It more common on the left side and may lead to a reduced sperm creation by increasing temperature, lessening the flow of blood or altering hormone levels.- A condition wherein all sperms in the ejaculate are dead.- A condition in which sperm do not get ejaculated in a forward direction and hence tend to reflux into the bladder. It can be produced by surgical nerve injury leading to the bladder neck, diabetes and side effects of medications.- Refers to sperms that are shaped abnormally.Medical Treatments that can aid in improving sperm quality in men, thus bringing the couple close to embracing the dream of parenthood:- This is a procedure in which sperms are instilled directly into the uterus to enable pregnancy.- This is an electrical stimulation of nerves that regulate ejaculation. It is utilized to get semen from men suffering from injuries of the spinal cord.(Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) - This is a process in which sperm is injected into an oocyte on specialised IVF equipment. This is one of the main treatments for male factor infertility.(Testicular Sperm Aspiration) and- (Percutaneous Sperm Retrieval) - This is a clinical practice in which the testicle or epididymis are biopsied in order to obtain sperm for ICSI.- These are sperms that have been donated. This option is in cases of men with no sperm or very insufficient sperm. Potential donors are thoroughly screened for sexually transmitted diseases including HIV. Bodily, therapeutic and individual characteristics are provided to aid in matching various traits. By Law, donors need to remain anonymous.The bottom lines are that infertility affects many men around the globe, but can be treated with timely medical assistance and intervention. Additionally, a healthy lifestyle and well-balanced diet are extremely significant in improving your sperm count."

GMCH drug shortage leaves AIDS patients in the lurch,2018-11-21,Aurangabad,"News,City News,Aurangabad News","Aurangabad: The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), dealing with the issue of medicine shortage, is now forcing patients suffering from AIDS to buy expensive drug from private pharmacies.The hospital administration said that the drugs will be made available for the patients in the next two to three days. The Anti-Retro Viral Therapy (ART) centre was established in the state-run hospital in 2006 and it provides counselling, consultation, drugs and follow-up for around 4,000 patients.The HIV positive patients with a CD4 count of less than 350 are also treated at the ART. One of the key aspects of the treatment is that patient must strictly follow the medicine schedule.Any irregularity in following the prescribed roster can lead resistance to HIV drugs, and can weaken or negate its effect.Under the central government’s AIDS programme, the drugs are dispatched from Delhi to the distribution centre at Nagpur and then to the GMCH and other ART sub-centres across the district.At GMCH, a software is in place to keep track of the patients, drugs prescribed to them and manage the inventory. Based on this system, the patients are provided the date and time to take drugs from the store.However, for the last 10 days, the drug store at ART is running short on key drug. The hospital has put up a board to inform the patients about it and they have been asked to buy the drugs from private pharmacies.Meenakshi Bhattacharya, head of department of medicine, said considering the large coverage of the ART system these things happen sometimes. “There are more than 3,000 patients in every centre all over India and every medicine regimen costing approximately Rs 1,700 to 4,500 is given free of cost to the patients,” she said.She added that one of the tablets is not there but it will be available in 2 to 3 days. “We have asked the patients to buy the medicine from pharmacies until it becomes available at the hospital so that their treatment is not affected,” Bhattacharya said."
Stanley hospital to get stem cell lab early next year,2018-11-22,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Schools & Colleges","CHENNAI: A decade-old plan of the state government to start a stem cell lab at the Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital , for research in organ failures and therapy of blood disorders, is likely to start functioning by early 2019.If that happens, treatment for diseases such as multiple myeloma, leukemia, lymphoma and thalassemia will be available free of cost for patients, besides research for treatment of other ailments. The project which was approved in 2008, faced several hurdles including bureaucratic delays and was even pointed out by the comptroller auditor general in a recent report.Stem cells, found in embryos, cord blood and human beings, have the capability to develop into any kind of tissue. With the bank, the hospital will develop a therapy for end-stage liver diseases, for which the only option available now is liver transplant.On December 10, officials from the Indian Council of Medical Research and Directorate General of Drug Control will visit the laboratory to check infrastructure, manpower and manufacturing practices for issue of licence. “If we get the licence, we will be able to start human trials for liver failure,” said surgical gastroenterologist Dr Jeswanth Satyanesan.At least 60% of the deliveries in the state happen in government hospitals and they will use cord blood and placenta as the main source of stem cells for research. Besides these, a small portion of healthy liver tissues dissected along with diseased livers during surgeries at the hospital can also be sources of stem cells, doctors said.Though it sounds simple, it means a lot of work. Unlike the cells drawn from the embryo, not all cells in the cord blood or adult tissues are stem cells and have to be isolated after screening for diseases like hepatitis, HIV and rubella. They are later developed in a cultured medium. Doctors and scientists at the hospital have seen some success with stem cell therapy in animals. “We cause injuries in the livers of mice. Mice that were treated with stem cells had better outcomes compared to those given standard treatment. We are hoping this will work in humans too,” he said.The state is also considering setting up a public stem cell bank to provide stem cells at a subsidised cost, said director of medical education Dr A Edwin Joe. “Many people who opt for treatment in private hospitals can’t afford stem cells. We are planning to see if we can offer stem cells at a lower cost. Commercial aspects are yet to be worked out,” he said."
Mumbai: Free HIV tests at six railway stations for a week from Dec 1,2018-11-24,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News,Civic Issues News","MUMBAI: In a bid to change the negative attitude towards HIV testing, Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) will offer free tests at six railway stations with maximum footfalls on December 1, World AIDS Day.The test will be available for a week at Rs75 almost a fifth of the usual cost at 700 laboratories of the private Metropolis laboratory from December.“We are focusing on normalising HIV testing,’’ said Dr Shrikala Acharya of MDACS ahead of World AIDS Day, whose theme is ‘Know your status’. If tests are easily available at public places for free or at affordable rates, testing may be seen as a socially accepted concept. “At present, if people are asked to undergo a test by their doctor or health worker, they will come up with an excuse or say this test is not for them as they are safe,’’ she said.There are 38,000 people with the virus who have registered with MDACS in Mumbai city, but there is no corresponding estimate for the private sector so far.MDACS will put up kiosks at CSTM, Dadar, Kurla, Andheri, Ghatkopar and Borivli stations to make the test easily accessible.Experts admit that the stigma attached to HIV and AIDS is still high, preventing people from testing themselves, leading to a delay in the start of treatment. “We want to make testing a social movement. It should be a normal question to ask each other if one has undergone the HIV test,’’ she added.MDACS will carry out social media campaigns with Marathi film and TV actors to promote HIV testing. “The idea is to create a social movement of sorts so that people forget the stigma attached to HIV testing,” she said."
Sexually Transmitted Infection: Condom-less sex popular thanks to pre-exposure drugs: Doctors,2018-11-25,NAGPUR,"News,City News,Nagpur News","NAGPUR: More and more urban youths are chucking out condoms as the market gets flooded with tablets that claim almost 100% protection from sexually transmitted disease (STDs). Some senior medical experts who specialize in STD told TOI that ‘pre-exposure drugs’ are oral medicines that can be taken just hours before sexual intercourse and are known to provide protection against even the deadliest of diseases.Senior dermatologist Dr JK Maniar, who practices in Mumbai, is one of the leading authorities on HIV/AIDS. He says that the success rate of such drugs is very high. “I would say over 99%. So, basically a person can consume this drug and have unprotected sex with an HIV infected person without any medical risk. The consumption of the pre-exposure drugs (PEDs) have gone up drastically as youths do not want any barriers.”Some other senior doctors from Mumbai, all of whom have decades of experience in treating STD patients, too agreed that nowadays patients do not want lectures on morality. Dr. Nina Madani, whose patients are mostly from south Mumbai, said, “We have to accept that lifestyles have changed and it’s a different era now. What we want is that youths should be aware and practice safe sex. In fact, I have so many young girls coming to me and seeking medical consultation for their sex life.”While strictly respecting the doctor-patient confidentiality norms, all of them did share an overall view of the changing sexual habits of people. Dr RD Kharkar said, “It is very common for people to have multiple sexual partners both within and outside of marriage. And patients are very open about it and that is why they are seeking best medical option available to ensure that they are safe even with the lifestyle they live.”Dr Maniar said he is also seeing many gay patients who come to seek advice. “They want to know the level of risk they have with same sex partners and how to prevent it. Multiple sex partners is becoming a reality and in such situation the priority for a doctor is provide good medical advice and that is what the patient is also looking for,” said Mania.Elite sex workers are also increasingly frequenting these top doctors and seeking advice of sexually transmitted infections and diseases. Dr. Madani said, “The trend now being of many not preferring a condom means the chances of infections increase drastically. So everyone wants to know what precautions to take when having multiple sex partners.”"
Mediations help in AIDS fight,2018-12-01,KANNUR,"News,City News,Kozhikode News","KANNUR: Forget preaching pseudo morality. Targeted interventions among female sex workers and MSM (men who have sex with men) seem to be more helpful in preventing spread of AIDS Most sex workers have now started engaging in sex with a limited number of clients and that too with only those who are personally known to them, according to people working among such communities.NGOs working among sex workers said the clients are also ready to undergo frequent medical check-ups.""Nowadays, not many of them are seen on the streets. They work during daytime and meet only a limited number of clients who are known to them,"" said Shaji P M, coordinator of Chola, a Kannur-based NGO.Since the sex workers know most of their clients, they make sure that the ones who come to them undergo medical check-ups for HIV and other infections, he said.There are 749 female sex workers in contact with Chola and nearly 80% of them practice such methods, he said, adding there were 12 HIV-infected sex workers here a few years ago but none of them are working in the sex industry now. With the advent of smartphones and social media, the coordination has become easy for them and it has reduced the risk.According to Snehatheeram, another NGO, sexual minorities, including members of the MSM community, have also been following such methods . In the MSM community, there are people from all classes and now most of them indulge in sexual activity with known partners and it has reduced the risk of HIV infection, said an employee of the NGO. Thanks to such interventions initiated by the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS), with the support of the NGOs, the risk of HIV infection has come down considerably, said Dennis Joseph , joint director of the society. ""The spread of HIV among sex workers has been reduced from 1.75% nearly a decade back to 0.01% now,"" he said.Last year, only four cases of HIV infection were reported among the sex workers in the state, and only two of them were registered with KSACS and two were outsiders, said KSACS.Similar interventions were made among drug users which helped them curb the habit of sharing syringes. Moreover, after realizing that they resort to crime to get money to procure drugs, facility was provided to get them drug, as part of the treatment, he said.As a result, the prevalence of HIV infection rate among drug abusers has come down from 10.5% to 0.41% in the past one decade, said the KSACS joint director."

HIV: How this HIV-infected MP man gives hope to others,2018-12-01,BHOPAL,"News,City News,Bhopal News,Civic Issues","BHOPAL: Manish Sharma, a kirana shop owner in Ujjain, tested positive for HIV in 2004 when his wife was pregnant. Struck by the tragedy and worried for his soon-to-be-born child, Sharma's life turned upside-down and he did not know what to do.With a strong determination to lead a normal life, Sharma started Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) treatment with his family's support. Besides, he also set up a shelter home for HIV-positive orphaned children in his hometown Ujjain in 2014.""I was suffering from some health issues and was diagnosed with liver infection. I decided to go for a thorough medical check-up. The results left me in utter shock. I was more worried about my pregnant wife and the yet-to-be-born child,"" he said while sharing his ordeal with the TOI. ""My mother proved my biggest strength. I went to the National AIDS Control Organisation in Delhi for treatment where I came across a person, who was on ART treatment for last 10 years and was leading a normal life. The meeting gave me a new hope. I got my wife tested. Thankfully, she tested negative and later we also got our son tested who also tested negative. I breathed a sigh of relief and started my medicines,"" said Sharma.Speaking about the stigma faced by HIV-positive persons, Sharma said apart from common people, some doctors too are biased against HIV+ and AIDS patients. ""I fractured my thigh in 2014, but doctors refused to perform surgery when they found out that I was HIV positive. Even pregnant HIV-positive women face difficulties as doctors refuse to perform delivery. This mentality has to be done away with,"" he said.In 2006, Sharma set up Ujjain HIV/AIDS Network People's Society where he works for the welfare of HIV-positive people. ""Many people lose hope of leading a normal life. We come together and help them start ART treatment and also provide them morale support. There is a myth that HIV-positive people cannot get married or have children. We got many HIV-positive people married and with proper treatment their children tested negative which gave them hope,"" he said.Sharma also started working for HIV-positive children after he came across cases where such children had nowhere to go after their parents died and relatives refused to take them in. With the help of a local missionary he established a shelter home for HIV positive orphans in 2014. ""Ours is the only centre for HIV-positive kids in the state. The centre has 36 inmates and we hope many more shelters to come up in MP. The ART is provided to children by the government while the missionary provides them with food and shelter. We have come far from where we started but we still have a long way to go,"" Sharma concluded."

But now she is in the PGI with a severe neurological complication and is helplessly looking for monetary support. She has been counselling many HIV positives and the irony is that now she is struggling with a disease with hardly anyone to look after her.For her colleagues who had been collecting money for her treatment, she is a face remembered only during the World AIDS Day . But nothing has changed even after she was recognized for her relentless work. “With lot of difficulty, we could collect Rs 12,000 for a test in the PGI for Pooja. We had also approached the project director of State Aids Control Society (SACS), but in vain,” said Meena Vij, working with the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV AIDS.At a young age of 21 years, Pooja lost her husband to AIDS.

In the absence of anyone she left her hometown in Himachal and since 2007 has been working at the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV AIDS.“I have three sons and after my admission in the PGI, I do not know how they are managing. I am in the hospital since the last three months. My brother and a friend helped me to get the tests done.

However, I have tried to help whatever was within my capacity.”"
When an Indian sex worker's tale brought Bill Gates to tears!,2018-12-01,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: Bill Gates during one of his several visits to India as part of the AIDS prevention programme of the Gates Foundation couldn't hold back his tears on hearing the story of a sex worker whose daughter committed suicide after being harassed and ostracised by her schoolmates, says a new book.Ashok Alexander, who headed the Gates Foundation's HIV/AIDS prevention programme Avahan for over 10 years, has come out with a book “A Stranger Truth: Lessons in Love, leadership and Courage from India's Sex Workers” in which he talks about the country's sex workers, their lives, how India is a success story in the epidemic and what leadership skills and life lessons can be learnt from them.The author mentions true stories of the lives of sex workers in India that are about finding hope and redemption amid heartbreak and despair.During their visits, Bill and wife Melinda had the ability to completely shut out everything extraneous and focus on the community of sex workers, the author says.""They sat cross-legged on the floor, facing the community members who were sitting in a small circle. Melinda asked some of them if they would relate their stories. All the tales were sad ones - of rejection, utter poverty, and then somewhere a spark of hope. They were brutally honest and raw.""One of the stories is about an incident that took place during Gates' visit to India in the early 2000s. A woman related to Gates how she had hidden the fact that she was a sex worker from her daughter, who was then in high school.When her classmates found out the truth, they relentlessly teased, harassed and ostracised the girl, who soon went into deep depression.""One day her mother came home to find her child hanging from the ceiling fan, and a note left behind saying she could not take it any more. I noticed that Bill, next to me, had his head down and was crying quietly,"" Alexander recalls in the book, published by Juggernaut.When Alexander left a high-profile corporate job to head Avahan in 2003, he was plunged into an India far removed from the comfort zones he had lived and worked in all his life.It was a grinding place where women sold themselves for Rs 50 and 14-year-olds injected drugs. It was the shadow world of transgenders and of young gay men in a country that criminalised same-sex love then.It was the strange world of truckers, lonely journeymen along forgotten highways. Above all, it was a place where valiant battles for a barely decent life were being fought every day."
500 new HIV cases reported in Uttarakhand this year,2018-12-01,DEHRADUN,"News,City News,Dehradun News","DEHRADUN: A total of 503 cases of HIV+ have been reported from January to October this year, data compiled by Uttarakhand State AIDS Control Society has revealed.

Four cases were recorded in Bageshwar, Chamoli and Champawat.Among high-risk categories of patients are migrants, truck drivers and prisoners.

Quite disturbingly, many young girls are taking to drugs due to peer pressure,” Dangwal added.Meanwhile, according to Sanjay Singh Bisht of the Uttarakhand State AIDS Control Society, “The ratio of positive cases as compared to number of tests done every year in Uttarakhand is decreasing.”"
Sanitary napkins not disposed of properly,2018-11-30,COIMBATORE,"News,City News,Coimbatore News","COIMBATORE: Two months after the city corporation issued notices to nearly 250 educational institutions with hostels to dispose of sanitary napkins either in specific incinerators or hand it over to the pollution control board, such waste is still found with wet waste, forcing sanitary workers to remove them with their hands and dump them in landfills.The corporation had on October 1 asked the educational institutions to dispose of all forms of biomedical waste - including sanitary napkins, tampons, research lab waste, first aid waste, expired drugs and used insulin needles, razors, blades and even condoms - in incinerators or hand them over to the pollution control board for disposal.“Many sanitary workers are often unsure of how to dispose the above medical waste,” said a senior corporation official. “They come under non-degradable waste, which cannot be composted or recycled. So, they end up in landfills.”The pollution control board’s guidelines for managing sanitary waste state that biomedical waste should be disposed of using high temperature incinerators or deep burial, which is only recommended in villages and small towns. While most hospitals have their own incinerators or share facilities among themselves, educational institutions and domestic households end up disposing biomedical waste with wet waste.“Sanitary napkins contain plastic and super absorbent polymers, which will not degrade for many years. But the toxins and chemicals in them will leech out and start affecting the whole ecosystem,” said S Sudhakar, who runs a biomedical waste incinerator called Tekno Therm Industries in the city.According to biomedical waste experts, improper disposal of sanitary napkins, bandages and used first aid waste would cause multiple problems. “The napkins and pieces of used cotton could pose a threat of HIV and tuberculosis, among others, to the sanitary workers handling the waste,” Sudhakar said.“The waste could become a thriving ground for bacteria and virus, which when sniffed or carried by stray dogs or other birds could even spread,” said an official.A few educational institutions and smaller clinics have incinerators to dispose of their waste, but experts say they don’t follow all the rules. “The rules clearly state that the waste should be burned in incinerator at specific temperatures like 850C, but many institutions use inexpensive incinerators and burn waste at around 100C, which actually does more harm than good because it releases effluents,” Sudhakar said.According to the city corporation, the biomedical waste, which does not end up in landfills, ends up clogging drains and even rivers and other water bodies."
People show there are no full stops after HIV/AIDS,2018-12-01,NASHIK,"News,City News,Nashik News","NASHIK: Near a decade back, a Nashik couple was looking forward to hearing the “good news” after taking a blood test. The results, however, shocked them.The woman was detected with HIV . Later, her husband was also detected with the same condition. The news shattered them and their difficulties seemed to have just begun. But they found a way out and were determined to live life to the fullest.Today, they live in a joint family and are well-known ‘care counsellors’ in Nashik and Malegaon . Both are trained paraprofessionals and offer a ray of hope to hundreds of others in Nashik district , who were detected with HIV.“When we were detected with HIV, we still decided to go ahead with the pregnancy and not to abort our child. We followed entire medical treatment, hoping that our child would be HIV negative. But, when my son was born, he was also detected HIV,” she recalled.Her husband had lost his job in a private company. They decided to leave their son with their family and end their lives. Just then, they got in touch with support groups for HIV positive people and found a source of living.“We got a work to stitch cloth bags and hand gloves. We started earning a bit. Gradually, we were introduced with the concept of paraprofessionals. As we were educated, we both underwent the training and started working as counsellors. Today, we are leading counsellors in Nashik district,” he said.Their families have accepted them whole heartedly and they live in a joint family. “We regularly take medicines and live a good life. When we share our story with other HIV+ people, they get inspired,” he said.Another couple like them was detected with HIV when they were expecting their first child. Their daughter does not have HIV infection. They have also dedicated their lives for creating awareness about HIV/AIDS “It’s the mission of our lives now. God has blessed us with a healthy baby girl and it’s enough for us. We want her to become a doctor in the future,” the man said.This couple works in Nashik city and has successfully convinced many HIV+ patients to get treatment and take their medicines.“People can lead a healthy life for a long time with appropriate medical care. Anti-retroviral therapy effectively suppresses replication, if taken at the right time. Positive attitude, hopeand family support play a very important role in fight against AIDS,” he said.Both couples work with the Yash Foundation, which offers relief and rehabilitation to HIV/AIDS affected people. “We run a paraprofessional course that aims at encouraging youth to participate in tackling various social issues. This programme is implemented in partnership with colleges and includes sensitizing youth on adolescent health and HIV, life skills educations, leadership and personality development,” said Ravi Patil, director of Yash Foundation.“Awareness on health and HIV remains crucial. There are 108 wards under Nashik Municipal Corporation where we have initiated various community development programmes,” he said.Till date, the organization has covered 82 school and colleges and conducted training sessions on HIV/AIDS and social issues.

"Indian banks now target Mallya's Indian Empress superyacht in bid to get back Rs 10,000 crore",2018-12-01,LONDON,"News,World News,UK News","LONDON: Indebted tycoon Vijay Mallya’s flamboyant lifestyle has taken another hit after a consortium of 13 Indian banks trying to claw back Rs 10,000 crore they are owed by Mallya are now after the proceeds of the sale of his 95-metre superyacht Indian Empress.The yacht, which he purchased in 2006 and spent £5 million (about Rs 44.5 crore today) refurbishing in 2015, with a 15-seater cinema, spa and steam room, beauty salon and gentleman’s lounge, is currently impounded and moored at Valletta, Malta.The yacht, which boasts four decks and a massive sundeck for entertaining, is where Mallya held some of the most swanky Formula One parties during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend, inviting more than 1,000 guests.Built in 2000 by Dutch yard Oceanco for a member of the Qatari royal family, the yacht, estimated to be worth $93 million (about Rs 648 crore), was abandoned by Mallya in Malta in September 2017, allegedly over unpaid maritime bills.The seafarers’ union Nautilus International had the vessel arrested by maritime creditors in March 2018 to recover unpaid wages for more than 40 crew, including Indians, owed more than $1 million (Rs 6.97 crore, approximately) in wages.It was sold in September 2018 at a judicial re-auction as part of the arrest proceedings for €35 million (about Rs 277 crore) to Maltese Society Sea Beauty Yachting Limited and has been renamed “NEOM”. Neom is the name of a new city being built in Saudi Arabia so it is believed the new owner may have links to the Middle East.The vessel, which is registered in the Isle of Man, was abandoned with possessions on board, belonging to both Mallya and his guests, including a grand piano belonging to Elton John and original Picasso and M F Husain paintings. These were part of the auction.Mallya bought the piano, which Elton John had used to write Songs from the West Coast, for €226,000 (about Rs 1.8 crore) at a charity auction in May 2008 in aid of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.Barclays Bank is the lead party in the case against the vessel in Malta’s civil court first hall, being the main secured creditor, having lent two mortgages in 2008 and 2018 against it, worth just under €25 million (about Rs 198 crore).Law firm TLT LLP in London, which represents the consortium of 13 Indians banks, secured a court order in the commercial court of the London high court this week to help it get a slice of the yacht’s proceeds.Whilst the banks are not creditors owed money by the yacht, the banks are seeking to secure the net sale proceeds, after the payment of maritime creditors, such as fuel suppliers, who rank in priority.According to the court papers in Malta, which TOI has seen, there are a number of creditors, in addition to Barclays Bank, but the total amount being claimed by all the creditors of the vessel does not exceed €28 million (Rs 221 crore, approximately).The creditors will be paid from the €35 million via a process called a “competition of creditors” procedure.Since there will be a surplus of monies due back to the yacht’s owners, the banks are seeking to obtain that surplus in the Maltese courts rather than it being paid back to the yacht’s previous owner, Mallya.The order, dated November 28, 2018, by Mr Justice Phillips, grants the banks permission to use information provided pursuant to the worldwide freeze order on Mallya’s assets they had obtained in November 2017, in respect of the court proceedings in Malta involving Indian Empress."
"sex workers: Weak in flesh, positive in battling the scourge",2018-12-01,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Delhi News","NEW DELHI: The sun has set, and in the dark corner of Panchkuian Road, which branches off from Connaught Place, sex workers wait for their work to begin. From the shadows a pair of eyes scans the street, but not for customers. The eyes are on the sex workers themselves. They belong to a bespectacled 62-year-old. As Khushi trudges around, a walking stick in hand, she is keenly looking out for those who might need help in seeking treatment to keep the human immunodeficiency virus at bay.On World AIDS Day on December 1, people like Khushi will not be feted. They are the anonymous troops engaged in the ground battle against the scourge . An HIV patient herself and a woman trapped in a man’s body, Khushi has only ever lived life in the margins. But undeterred, she has worked for 15 years now to check the spread of HIV by providing the sex walkers with condoms and identifying AIDS patients and persuading them to accompany her to hospitals.Born in Uttar Pradesh’s Rampur, known for its eponymous switchblade, Khushi (name changed to protect her identity) experienced the horrors of bullying and taunts early in life. Her protective mother sent her to a woman doctor’s home hoping this would shelter her from the cruel world, but the 10-year-old domestic help got no respite and was sexually abused by the doctor’s son. “When I couldn’t bear it any longer, I ran away to Delhi to live with a relative hoping that a new city would give me a chance at a new life,” the ageing transgender recalls with a sigh.In the capital, she spent her days selling incense sticks on the street, doing odd jobs, vulnerable and exploited several times over. “There were days when I was so scared and shaken that I didn’t have the courage to leave my room,” she says. Then, in her late 30s, Khushi was diagnosed with HIV.Her flesh , literally, was weak , but her spirit was willing. Her treatment first in AIIMS and then in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital bore fruit and she became an HIV survivor. A meeting with RML medical counsellor Poonam Goel changed her attitude to life. Goel taught her how to recognise the symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases and encouraged her to find patients of such among sex workers and bring them to hospital.This proved easier said than done. Many sex workers were unwilling to be seen in a hospital. But Goel testifies, “Khushi brought in hundreds of HIV-positive people from place like Azadpur Mandi and Jahangirpuri who had been unwilling to seek treatment fearing the disclosure of their identity. She convinced them to come to the hospital, even sometimes if in a burka.”Khushi’s biggest challenge is helping the HIV patients overcome the fear of stigma. She convinces those she meets in her mission field in Azadpur Mandi, Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, Model Town and Sindhu border by telling them that unlike her diagnosis in the early 1990s when medicines were not easily available, free treatment at government hospitals can help them live a long life. “My job doesn’t finish with helping them with the formalities,” she adds. “I keep tabs on the patients. I keep their medical cards with me so I know whether they are taking home the prescribed medicines from the hospitals in time.”On December 1, as the night falls and people retreat into their houses, Khushi steps out, knowing she has an unfinished business on the streets."
‘HIV patients fail to follow up on therapy’,2018-11-30,PANAJI,,"PANAJI: The Goa Medical College’s Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) centre has lost over 500 patients registered with it for treatment.An official said the centre is facing a major challenge with follow-ups as many avoid the therapy fearing side effects while many others feel that there is no need to take the treatment continuously when they are fit. The biggest fallout of this is that when patients finally turn up with opportunist infections, it is too late to do anything for them.“They come to us and beg to be saved from dying. At that stage, we are really helpless,” he said.At the centre, patients on therapy are counselled to continue with the treatment regime, as non-adherence has high chances of them developing resistance to drugs.An official said that while drug resistance can occur even among patients, who have been on ART for a long period, skipping the therapy without a consultant’s advice will also do no good. The ART centre has about 200 cases of first-line failure and about 15 cases of secondline failure.He said when a patient develops resistance to drugs, it complicates matters even for the doctor, adding some patients simply disappear after starting the therapy.“To avoid follow-up, they do everything possible to stay away. They change their contact numbers and even residence,” he said.The centre’s staff has now stopped tracing such patients following a directive of the National AIDS Control Organisation.A positive development for the centre is that it no longer needs to send blood samples to JJ Hospital for detecting a viral load of HIV/ AIDs persons. They get samples tested at an independent laboratory in Mumbai and results are received on mail the very next day, while a hard copy is received within a month. This, he said is a major relief for patients developing drug resistance as drugs can be altered without much delay.In the past, he said persons failing to respond to ART had to visit the Mumbai centre to get their drugs but now they can avail it here except those who are on thirdline regime."

Chennai: Steep increase in HIV/AIDS infection among Tamil Nadu youth,2018-12-01,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Civic Issues","CHENNAI: As the government prepares to observe International Day for AIDS on Saturday, the state is witnessing a steep increase in new HIV/AIDS infection among youngsters despite an overall fall in new cases.Public health experts suspect unprotected sex and exchanging of needles in the 10-25 age group in the state to be the major reasons behind the spurt. While increase in cases has also been seen among the elderly, there is a drastic decline among other age groups.Tho ugh the incidence of the infection in TN, which recorded 43% of all cases in the country in 2003, has come down to less than 10% this year, it has gone up from 160 in 2015-16 to 187 in 2017-18 in the 10-19 age group. At least 99 people in the age group have tested positive between April and October this year.In the 20-25 age group, the number of cases has gone up from 432 in 2015 to 554 in 2017-18. At least 318 cases have been recorded between April and October this year. In the 60 and above age group, the numbers went up to 699 in 2017-18 from 536 cases in 2015-16. This year, 435 cases have been recorded between April and October.‘Use social media for HIV awareness’Project director, Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society, K Senthil Raj, said, “There are a lot of dating apps and social media websites that encourage youngsters to get into active sex life. Older methods of attracting target audience such as sex workers and truckers will not work with them. While it is important to keep a tab on conventional spots, it is equally important to use social media and dating apps to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS.”While several surveys, including those carried out by the union health ministry, have recorded significant drop in awareness about HIV/AIDS in the state, funding from the Centre, state and external agencies to AIDS control society too have fallen. This year of the 69 crore outlay, 55 crore went towards salaries. “Most of our staff have been working here for more than 15 years and the salaries have substantially increased. In addition, 13 crore was given to NGOs for various programmes,” said a senior officer at TANSACS.The number of people testing positive at the voluntary testing and counselling centres have dropped to mere 30%. “This means a majority of people are being tested positive at the tertiary care centres where they go with complaints of other diseases or complications of HIV. This also means they are not diagnosed early,” said R Madhuri, a psychologist who has been working in capacity building projects with NGOs. “It means the battle against AIDS is far from over,” she said.“We are doing all that we can to grab the attention of youth,” said Senthil Raj. This year, the society has organised a meme contest to create awareness on the infection. The state had received over 1,000 memes, mostly from people below the age of 30 years."
Woman claims husband gave her HIV through saline,2018-12-01,PUNE,"News,City News,Pune News,Crime","PUNE: A 27-year-old woman from Thergaon lodged a complaint with the Wakad police on Thursday alleging that her husband, a homeopath, had administered her HIV-infected blood through saline to secure a divorce from her besides harassing her for dowry.Senior inspector Satish Mane of the Wakad police said, “Medical reports of the woman shows that she has been infected with HIV from January. She alleged that her husband had injected her with infected blood while administrating saline when she was unwell in March last year.”The woman said she underwent clinical tests when her condition deteriorated. “The woman stated in her complaint that she did not have physical relationships with anyone other than her husband,” Mane said.He said the police were yet to investigate if the husband was responsible for administering the HIV-infected blood into her body. “Based on her complaint, we have booked her husband and sent her blood samples to a laboratory,” Mane said.Infectious disease expert Bharat Purandare said, “It is possible to transmit HIV either through an infected needle or by giving transfusion of infected blood. If the woman knows whose infected needle or blood was used to transmit the virus, a DNA test can be carried out on her and the HIV-affected person to establish the link.”The woman stated in her complaint after her marriage in 2015, her husband and in-laws started harassing her for money to start a business. “The woman’s father used to give in to their demands. However, the woman later refused to contact her father for more money, resulting in mental and physical harassment by the in-laws and her husband,” Mane said.The woman said her husband hatched a plot to administer her HIV-infected blood because he did not have strong grounds for a divorce. The husband and his parents have been booked under sections 498A, 323, 504 and 506 of IPC. “The husband has already filed for divorce in court,” Mane said."
No. of pregnant women testing HIV+ dips; still over 600 this year,2018-12-01,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: Despite significant progress in containing the spread of HIV among the general population, over 600 pregnant women have tested positive for the virus in the state this year. In the last five years, over 6,300 women were detected with the virus during pregnancy, underlining the urgent need to reach out to people who may be living with the virus but are unaware of their status.This World AIDS Day, as there is a global clamour for expansion of HIV-testing and treatment under the theme of ‘Know your status’, activists demanded that government agencies must push facilities deeper into the community.Dr Ashok Anand, who heads the gynaecology department at JJ Hospital, that carries out a massive volume of HIV positive childbirths, said even today, hundreds of women find out their status only during their pregnancy.“Most women get the infection from husbands. In fact, many husbands know about their HIV status only when their wives are pregnant,” said Dr Anand. Data from Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) shows that 92% of infections are due to unsafe sex, a significant percentage of which is among heterosexual couples. The remaining are caused by transfusion with infected blood, use of infected needles or from mother to child. Dr Anand said prevention was better as always, as an infected mother also stands the risk of passing on the virus to the child.While with multiple-drug regimen the incidence of mother-to-child transmission has reduced a great deal, some babies continue to get the infection from mothers. Since 2014-15, nearly 300 babies have got HIV infection from mothers in the state. Activist Ganesh Acharya said it was time to remodel targeted interventions and penetrate communities deeper. “We need more behaviour change communication to encourage more to get tested,” he said, adding that people still getting HIV in large numbers suggest that programmes may be failing.Maharashtra State Aids Control Organisation (MDACS) officials said a decade ago more than 4,000 pregnant women tested positive every year. “The number of women testing positive declined by 85% over 10 years, even as women being screened more than doubled,” said a senior official. He said from nearly 8 lakh in 2008, over 21 lakh pregnant women were now being screened annually in Maharashtra.MDACS assistant project director Dr Shrikala Acharya said to facilitate testing BMC has tied up with 113 outlets of Metropolis where HIV test will be carried out for Rs75 for a week from December 1."
Goa’s LGBTQ community gets its own trust,2018-11-25,PANAJI,"News,City News,Goa News,Civic Issues","PANAJI: After a Supreme Court verdict in their favour, members of the LGBTQ community in Goa have successfully got a trust registered to help others come out.Founder and president of Goa Rainbow Trust, Chris Fernandes, wants to lend a non-judgemental ear to the community and use the trust to guide those who are still closeted.“It’s not advisable to come out until one is financially stable, which is the message we seek to spread,” she says, adding that the safest way would be to break the news in bits and pieces and avoid any angry outbursts.“We set up the trust because we want to let members of the community know that there is someone looking out for them,” Rishabh Chodankar, a trustee, says. “We seek to create more awareness about the community among heterosexuals and dispel misconceptions about sexual orientation and gender identification.”The trust will also work towards uniting the diverse community of gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders. “It is the first trust set up in Goa catering to the entire umbrella of the queer community,” vice-president Francis Fernandes , says. The idea is to provide a family-like safe space for the closeted and those who have already come out, so that they don’t feel lonely or depressed. “We want them to feel like they belong somewhere,” he says.The trust also has a helpline on the anvil, which Mapusa-based Francis says is necessary, considering that many are ostracised and feel they have no hope.“One of the biggest challenges the community faces is acceptance by family. Such people may not feel comfortable opening up to counsellors. We are in a better position to understand and advise them with our experience,” Chris says.Where the transgender community is concerned, the trust is looking at organising activities to help them refrain from taking up prostitution. “No doubt it is big money, but we want to tell them that once their contract HIV, their immune system will never be the same,” Chris says, adding that the trust is accessible not only to LGBTQ people but also to their families and friends.The organisation will also have its own a bank account. “We want to work professionally and within the legal framework and don’t want any problems to arise in the future,” Chris says.“It’s not just about us. There will be many who will be associated with us, so we want to do everything in accordance with the law,” Francis says."
First gene-edited babies claimed in China,2018-11-26,HONG KONG,News,"HONG KONG: A Chinese researcher claims that he helped make the world's first genetically edited babies — twin girls whose DNA he said he altered with a powerful new tool capable of rewriting the very blueprint of life.If true, it would be a profound leap of science and ethics.A US scientist said he took part in the work in China, but this kind of gene editing is banned in the United States because the DNA changes can pass to future generations and it risks harming other genes.Many mainstream scientists think it's too unsafe to try, and some denounced the Chinese report as human experimentation.The researcher, He Jiankui of Shenzhen, said he altered embryos for seven couples during fertility treatments, with one pregnancy resulting thus far. He said his goal was not to cure or prevent an inherited disease, but to try to bestow a trait that few people naturally have — an ability to resist possible future infection with HIV, the AIDS virus.He said the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed, and he would not say where they live or where the work was done.There is no independent confirmation of He's claim, and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by other experts. He revealed it Monday in Hong Kong to one of the organizers of an international conference on gene editing that is set to begin Tuesday, and earlier in exclusive interviews with The Associated Press.""I feel a strong responsibility that it's not just to make a first, but also make it an example,'' He told the AP. ""Society will decide what to do next'' in terms of allowing or forbidding such science.Some scientists were astounded to hear of the claim and strongly condemned it.It's ""unconscionable ... an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible,'' said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert and editor of a genetics journal.""This is far too premature,"" said Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. ""We're dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It's a big deal.""However, one famed geneticist, Harvard University 's George Church, defended attempting gene editing for HIV, which he called ""a major and growing public health threat.""""I think this is justifiable,"" Church said of that goal.In recent years scientists have discovered a relatively easy way to edit genes, the strands of DNA that govern the body. The tool, called CRISPR-cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that's causing problems.It's only recently been tried in adults to treat deadly diseases, and the changes are confined to that person. Editing sperm, eggs or embryos is different — the changes can be inherited. In the US, it's not allowed except for lab research. China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing.He Jiankui, who goes by ""JK,"" studied at Rice and Stanford universities in the U.S. before returning to his homeland to open a lab at Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, where he also has two genetics companies.The US scientist who worked with him on this project after He returned to China was physics and bioengineering professor Michael Deem, who was his adviser at Rice in Houston. Deem also holds what he called ""a small stake"" in — and is on the scientific advisory boards of — He's two companies.The Chinese researcher said he practiced editing mice, monkey and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods.He said he chose to try embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a big problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell.All of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, He said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes.Instead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate.He recruited couples through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin. Its leader, known by the pseudonym ""Bai Hua,"" told the AP that it's not uncommon for people with HIV to lose jobs or have trouble getting medical care if their infections are revealed.Here is how He described the work:The gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilization. First, sperm was ""washed"" to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene editing tool was added.When the embryos were 3 to 5 days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said.Tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, He said. People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV, although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do.Several scientists reviewed materials that He provided to the AP and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm.They also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes.""It's almost like not editing at all"" if only some of certain cells were altered, because HIV infection can still occur, Church said.Church and Musunuru questioned the decision to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, because the Chinese researchers said they knew in advance that both copies of the intended gene had not been altered.""In that child, there really was almost nothing to be gained in terms of protection against HIV and yet you're exposing that child to all the unknown safety risks,"" Musunuru said.The use of that embryo suggests that the researchers' ""main emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease,"" Church said.Even if editing worked perfectly, people without normal CCR5 genes face higher risks of getting certain other viruses, such as West Nile, and of dying from the flu. Since there are many ways to prevent HIV infection and it's very treatable if it occurs, those other medical risks are a concern, Musunuru said.There also are questions about the way He said he proceeded. He gave official notice of his work long after he said he started it — on Nov. 8, on a Chinese registry of clinical trials.It's unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits. For example, consent forms called the project an ""AIDS vaccine development"" program.The Rice scientist, Deem, said he was present in China when potential participants gave their consent and that he ""absolutely"" thinks they were able to understand the risks.Deem said he worked with He on vaccine research at Rice and considers the gene editing similar to a vaccine.""That might be a layman's way of describing it,"" he said.Both men are physics experts with no experience running human clinical trials.The Chinese scientist, He, said he personally made the goals clear and told participants that embryo gene editing has never been tried before and carries risks. He said he also would provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and plans medical followup until the children are 18 and longer if they agree once they're adults.Further pregnancy attempts are on hold until the safety of this one is analyzed and experts in the field weigh in, but participants were not told in advance that they might not have a chance to try what they signed up for once a ""first"" was achieved, He acknowledged. Free fertility treatment was part of the deal they were offered.He sought and received approval for his project from Shenzhen Harmonicare Women's and Children's Hospital, which is not one of the four hospitals that He said provided embryos for his research or the pregnancy attempts.Some staff at some of the other hospitals were kept in the dark about the nature of the research, which He and Deem said was done to keep some participants' HIV infection from being disclosed.""We think this is ethical,"" said Lin Zhitong, a Harmonicare administrator who heads the ethics panel.Any medical staff who handled samples that might contain HIV were aware, He said. An embryologist in He's lab, Qin Jinzhou, confirmed to the AP that he did sperm washing and injected the gene editing tool in some of the pregnancy attempts.The study participants are not ethicists, He said, but ""are as much authorities on what is correct and what is wrong because it's their life on the line.""""I believe this is going to help the families and their children,"" He said. If it causes unwanted side effects or harm, ""I would feel the same pain as they do and it's going to be my own responsibility."""
3 children die while 'playing with bomb' in Arunachal,2018-11-26,ITANAGAR,"News,City News,Itanagar News","ITANAGAR: Three children, including two girls, were reportedly killed in an accidental blast of a live bomb near an Army firing range in remote Anjaw district of Arunachal Pradesh on Saturday night, a senior district official said on Sunday.The incident occurred at Chirang village under Hayuliang circle, when the children, all in the age group of 7-10, were playing with the live explosive. The bomb had been collected by their parents from the nearby firing range and kept at the house, deputy commissioner D Riba said. The children were unaware of the danger of playing with the bomb and were unfortunately killed on the spot when it exploded, the DC said.The victims were identified as Anisha Krong (10), a student of class V, Yuman Krong (7) and Riya Krong (8), said officer-in-charge of Khupa police station, Hage Loder.Chief minister Pema Khandu has expressed deep shock and grief over the incident. Extending his condolences to the bereaved families, Khandu said the people of the state stand with the grieving family members during this trying time. As relief, Khandu has announced ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh each for the next of kin of the deceased from the Chief Minister's Relief Fund.The chief minister also cautioned villagers to avert going to danger zones like Army firing ranges, saying this could pose a threat to human lives. He also requested the Army to issue advisories or have prominent displays on boards depicting boundaries of danger zones or restricted areas, so that villagers do not trespass into such places."
Nitish Kumar cites WHO findings to support prohibition in Bihar; says 30 lakh people died because of alcohol globally in 2016,2018-11-26,PATNA,"News,India News","PATNA: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Monday said around 30 lakh people died because of harmful use of alcohol globally in 2016. It was 5.3% of all deaths in the world that year.Quoting a recent study by World Health Organisation (WHO), Nitish also pointed out that alcohol consumption causes death and disability relatively early in life. In the age group 20–39 years, 13.5 % of the total deaths in the world were alcohol-related, he said while addressing a prohibition and excise department’s function here.CM was citing the WHO report to highlight the bad impacts of alcohol consumption to tell people that his government took a very right decision by enforcing total prohibition in Bihar since April 5, 2016.Referring the WHO report published on September 21 this year, Nitish also pointed out that with 5.3% of all deaths in 2016, the adverse effects of alcohol consumption was greater than those of tuberculosis (2.3%), HIV/AIDS (1.8%), diabetes (2.8%), hypertension (1.6%), digestive diseases (4.5%), road injuries (2.5%) and violence (0.5%) across the world.Countering his critics who claim that the tourists’ flow has sharply gone down in Bihar after the enforcement of prohibition, Nitish said the tourists’ footfall in the state had increased after prohibition and it went above three crore people last year. More than 10 lakh foreign tourists arrived in the state last year, he said.Nitish also pooh-poohed his critics’ claim that the state had to suffer a huge revenue loss due to the liquor ban. “We suffered a revenue loss of Rs 1,000 crore only in the first financial year after the prohibition. After that the situation was completely normalised. The state government received extra revenue and taxes from other heads because the money saved by people due to the liquor ban were used in purchase of other consumer items from the market. In that way, people paid more taxes to the government,” CM said.Praising Nitish for enforcing prohibition in April 2016, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said, “It was not a simple decision. It could be done because of courage shown by Nitish Kumar.”"
"Docs: With preventive tablets handy, youths giving condoms a miss",2018-11-27,"Doctors are concerned about the rise in risky sexual behaviour among urban youth due to availability of prophylactic tablets which can prevent transmission of sexually-transmitted diseases such as HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs are recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO) for those in relationships with HIV-positive persons or drug-addicts who have shared needles recently.

Chinese geneticist reveals another 'potential' gene-edited pregnancy,2018-11-28,HONG KONG,News,"HONG KONG: A Chinese scientist at the centre of an ethical storm over what he claims are the world's first genetically edited babies said on Wednesday he is proud of his work and revealed there was a second ""potential"" pregnancy as part of the research.He Jiankui, an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, addressed a packed hall of around 700 people attending the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong.""For this case, I feel proud. I feel proudest,"" He said, when challenged by several peers at the conference.Asked whether there were any other edited gene pregnancies as part of his trials, He said there was another ""potential"" pregnancy and replied ""yes"" to a follow-up question as to whether it was a ""chemical pregnancy"", which refers to an early-stage miscarriage.It was unclear whether the pregnancy had ended or not.He, who said his work was self-funded, shrugged off concerns that the research was conducted in secrecy, explaining that he had engaged the scientific community over the past three years.""This study has been submitted to a scientific journal for review,"" He said. He did not name the journal and said his university was unaware of his study.In videos posted online this week, He said he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born this month.He said gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.But scientists and the Chinese government have denounced the work that He said he carried out, and a hospital linked to his research suggested its ethical approval had been forged.The conference moderator, Robin Lovell-Badge , said the summit organisers were unaware of the story until it broke this week.CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology that allows scientists to essentially cut and paste DNA, raising hope of genetic fixes for disease. However, there are concerns about safety and ethics.The Chinese Society for Cell Biology in a statement on Tuesday strongly condemned any application of gene editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes and said that it was against the law and medical ethics of China.More than 100 scientists, most in China, said in an open letter on Tuesday the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was dangerous and unjustified. ""Pandora's box has been opened,"" they said.He, who said he was against gene enhancement, said eight couples were initially enrolled for his study while one dropped out. The criteria required the father to be HIV positive and the mother to be HIV negative.Scientists at the conference pressed He to prove that those taking part in the trial were aware of all the risks involved in the process.He said that all the participants had a ""good education background"" and went through two rounds of discussions with him and his team.A 23-page English translation of an informed consent form for the potential mother said that the costs of the procedure covered by the team would be up to 280,000 yuan ($40,200) per couple.The consent form mentions multiple risks, but there is little detail on potential complications of the gene-editing process itself, including for the child. It does not mention that such an experiment has never been done before.David Baltimore, President Emeritus and the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology, spoke after He's speech, saying it was irresponsible to have proceeded until safety issues were in order.""I don't think it has been a transparent process. Only found out about it after it happened and the children were born,"" Baltimore said.He Jiankui said his results could be used for millions of people with inherited diseases. He said he would monitor the two newborns for the next 18 years and hoped they would support continued monitoring thereafter.Shenzhen Harmonicare Medical Holdings Limited, named as being involved in He's project in China's clinical trial registry, sought to distance itself by stating the hospital never participated in any operations relating to the gene-edited babies and no related delivery had taken place.In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Tuesday, the group said preliminary investigations indicated the signatures on the application form circulated on the internet are ""suspected to have been forged, and no relevant meeting of the Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital in fact took place"".The Guangdong province Health Commission announced on its website on Wednesday that it and Shenzhen city had set up a joint team to investigate the case."
"Life insurance news: Health cover may get dearer, life insurance cheaper",2018-11-29,MUMBAI,"News,BUSINESS NEWS,India Business News","MUMBAI: Buying life insurance is likely to get more affordable, while health insurance could get dearer. Improved life expectancy among the insured population will keep the cost of life cover down, but the cost of health covers is expected to move the other way because of various court directives asking insurers to cut out exclusions.According to Sanket Kawatkar, head of life insurance at actuarial consulting firm Milliman , there is an improvement of around 10% in the new mortality table, which is prepared by the Institutes of Actuaries of India. Insurance companies base their pricing on these mortality tables, which give the life expectancy starting from infancy for every year.According to Kawatkar, insurers may choose not to reflect the new tables because prices are already the lowest in the region. “Term insurance rates are cheaper in India compared to Australia. Although the life expectancy is higher there,” said Kawatkar. He added that one of the reasons why insurers can provide term insurance at low rates is because global reinsurers are supporting them.Global reinsurers are bullish on India as it is seen as the market with the highest latent demand. “The ‘protection gap’ in India is estimated at $9 trillion, making it one of the biggest markets in terms of potential,” said Heerak Basu, consulting actuary with Milliman. The term ‘protection gap’ as defined by Swiss Re is “the shortfall in the amount of cover necessary to maintain the current living standards of dependents”. Basu added that the use of technology for shortening and streamlining the sales and underwriting process is bringing down the cost of life insurance operations.While life insurance premiums are coming down, health insurance — the faster growing business for the industry — is expected to see an increase in rates. According to Lalit Baveja, senior health management consultant at Milliman, the scope of health insurance in India is set to increase due to court interventions for covering hitherto excluded illnesses like HIV, mental ailments and congenital defects. “Insurance companies will have to rework all their existing products to address these exclusions and file them with the insurance regulator with revised pricing,” said Baveja."
AIDS centre struggles to get patients’ kin tested,2018-11-29,PANAJI,"News,City News,Goa News,Civic Issues","PANAJI: For a long time now, the staff at Goa Medical College’s (GMC) antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre has been struggling to convince HIV/AIDS patients under its care to get their kin tested for the condition. Family members of not even 20% of the 8,000 HIV patients registered with ART have undergone the test. In the last few moth’s, four children were detected HIV positive after their parents reluctantly agreed to have them checked.An official from Goa state aids control society (GSACS) said, “Early detection is very important to control the spread of the virus. The disease is a critical, but manageable one, yet those afflicted keep it a secret, not only from the society, but also from their own family, thus, exposing them to the disease.”“It is difficult to accept the reality of testing positive. A majority will try and keep their status hidden,” said a counsellor who works with persons living with HIV/AIDs. The counsellor recounted about the time a 60-year-old woman from Sattari walked into the centre, complaining of severe headache and continuous body pain. The fragile, distressed woman caught the virus from her husband who died a while ago,” the counsellor further said, adding that in many instances, senior citizens infected with the virus are diagnosed late.“In another case, a woman tested positive after the death of her husband, who she had contracted the virus from. She was warned to her get son tested, but she never did so. Recently, her 24-year-old son also tested positive and is believed to have been infected via vertical transmission,” he said.The numbers of people with of HIV are dropping, but it is a matter of concern that carriers of the virus do not take precautions despite warning. “We could do better, only if all co-operate,” he said."

The event also marked the 10th anniversary of the foundation, which was started by transgender artist and activist Kalki Subramaniam to help change the lives transgender people.“Sahodari was born in pain,” says Kalki. “I was angry on seeing the way people from the transgender community were being treated. A transgender friend of mine was raped in front of my eyes and she died of HIV . So, I started Sahodari 10 years ago to work for the welfare of transgender people.”Through the foundation, a group of transgender people made a set of short films in 2009, depicting their lives. “The movies were widely viewed. The videos also helped to campaign for the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community in the legal battle to scrap Section 377,” Kalki says. Through the foundation, she has sensitized several school and college students.The event saw dance and music performances, plays and a discussion between Kalki and transgender writer and activist Revathi . Bara Bobby, a transgender engineering graduate, who is also a trained bharatanatyam dancer, performed a dance, while Soundarya, Sabitha and Vineetha, all from the transgender community, performed a group dance.Art is a potent way to claim one’s rights, say the artistes. “While there are several art festivals organised by the state, transgender people are not represented in them. But today we have created several avenues to showcase our talents,” says Revathi.Kalki expressed a similar view. “Art is both entertaining and educating. So, it’s a powerful tool to express ourselves.”"
"In 1997, this Indian doctor tried pig heart transplant, was jailed",2018-12-16,GUWAHATI,News,"GUWAHATI: Some days ago, researchers from Germany, Sweden and Switzerland reported in the journal Nature that “modifications to a cross-species transplantation approach … for the first time has enabled baboons that received genetically modified pig hearts to survive for more than six months”.Researchers at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany, led by transplantation researcher Bruno Reichart, replaced the hearts of five baboons with those from genetically engineered pigs. With this, human trials for inter-species transplants could finally be on the horizon.At Sonapur, 20 km from Guwahati, Dr Dhani Ram Baruah sits in his office in the eponymous ‘Heart City’, a 50-acre campus he set up decades ago with his life’s savings. A Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and Physicians in the UK, Baruah is today mainly confined to the premises, two decades after being arrested for transplanting a pig heart to a human recipient in 1997.Half a world away from Munich, Baruah is not surprised by the findings. “I was the pioneer,” he told TOI. “Whoever transplants a pig heart into a human now, I was the first to do it successfully with seven days’ survival. Xenotransplantation has a bright future if it goes in the right direction.”Way back in 1997, Baruah had transplanted a pig’s heart into a 32-year-old man, Purno Saikia, who had a ventricular septal defect, or hole in the heart. With Baruah was an equally controversial Hong Kong-based cardiac surgeon, Dr Jonathan Ho Kei-Shing. Ho had his own run-in with the Chinese government in 1992, when he fit heart valves made from ox tissue — designed by Baruah — into human patients.Saikia’s surgery, according to Baruah, lasted 15 hours. He died of multiple infections a week later. The survival period determined by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation for a xenotransplantation — the transplantation or infusion of any organ from one species to another — to be considered safe for human trial is 90 days.Before Baruah, few surgeons had managed to xenotransplant organs into humans. The survival rates had always been abysmal and each attempt had stirred a hornet’s nest.It was no different in Assam.Both Baruah and Ho were arrested and charged under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 18 of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 (removal of human organ without authority). Besides, the Dr Dhaniram Heart Institute and Research Centre was found to have “neither applied for nor obtained registration” as required under the transplant laws.The government alleged that the heart may not have been that of a pig — a claim that was later dismissed by Central Forensic Science Research Laboratory in Kolkata in June 1999. Baruah, now 68 years old, was released on bail after 40 days in jail.He returned to find his clinic and lab gutted, his animal farm destroyed, and his water and power supply cut off. He spent the next 18 months under virtual house arrest. He then survived on rainwater and little food, and depended on the charity of friends and his wife, also a doctor in Glasgow.When the controversy had erupted, Baruah was a heart surgeon of international standing. In the early-1980s, he was asked by then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Assam chief minister Hiteshwar Saikia to set up an openheart surgery clinic in his home state. In 1989, he set up a facility in Mumbai to manufacture the patented Baruah heart valve, which has since been used on patients the world over.After the controversy, public opinion and the media turned against him. Over nearly two years of being confined to the gutted campus, Baruah was subjected to taunts and abuse by residents of the area, who called him insane to his face. But the doctor carried on with his research.In the years since, Baruah has surfaced continually with claims considered bizarre or path-breaking — depending on which side of the debate one is on. In 2008, he claimed to have developed a “genetically engineered” vaccine that would “correct” congenital heart defects. In 2011, he claimed to have found the “cure” for HIV by “stopping the amplification of micro-RNA”. Four years later, he announced he had successfully isolated biological molecules from medicinal plants in the Himalayan region, the Baruah Biological Combat Genes, which he said would act as “biological missiles” to “kill HIV”.So where is Baruah investing his efforts now? “I have gone further ahead. I am making strides in applied human genetic engineering, with which the need for xenotransplantation itself will be reduced,” he said, wading into what could be yet another contentious territory. Meanwhile, he says patients continue to come to him for his “expertise”."

Nations agree on milestone rulebook for Paris climate treaty,2018-12-16,KATOWICE,"News,World News,Europe News","KATOWICE: Nations on Sunday struck a deal to breathe life into the landmark 2015 Paris climate treaty after marathon UN talks that failed to match the ambition the world's most vulnerable countries need to avert dangerous global warming.Delegates from nearly 200 states finalised a common rule book designed to deliver the Paris goals of limiting global temperature rises to well below two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit ).""Putting together the Paris agreement work programme is a big responsibility,"" said COP24 president Michal Kurtyka as he gavelled through the deal after talks in Poland that ran deep into overtime.""It has been a long road. We did our best to leave no one behind."" But states already dealing with devastating floods, droughts and extreme weather made worse by climate change said the package agreed in the mining city of Katowice lacked the bold ambition to cut emissions the world needed.Egyptian ambassador Wael Aboulmagd, chair of a the G77 & China negotiating bloc, said the rule book saw the ""urgent adaptation needs of developing countries relegated to a second-class status.""Executive director of Greenpeace Jennifer Morgan said: ""We continue to witness an irresponsible divide between the vulnerable island states and impoverished countries pitted against those who would block climate action or who are immorally failing to act fast enough.""The final decision text was repeatedly delayed as negotiators sought guidelines that could ward off the worst threats posed by our heating planet while protecting the economies of rich and poor nations alike.""Without a clear rulebook, we won't see how countries are tracking, whether they are actually doing what they say they are doing,"" Canada's Environment Minister Catherine McKenna told AFP.At their heart, negotiations were about how each nation funds action to mitigate and adapt to climate change, as well as how those actions are reported.Developing nations wanted more clarity from richer ones over how the future climate fight will be funded and pushed for so-called ""loss and damage"" measures.This would see richer countries giving money now to help deal with the effects of climate change many vulnerable states are already experiencing.Another contentious issue was the integrity of carbon markets, looking ahead to the day when the patchwork of distinct exchanges -- in China, the Europe Union, parts of the United States -- may be joined up in a global system.The Paris Agreement calls for setting up a mechanism to guard against practices, such as double counting emissions savings, that could undermine such a market. A major sticking point, delegates eventually agreed Saturday to kick the issue down the road until next year.One veteran observer told AFP Poland's presidency at COP24 had left many countries out of the process and presented at-risk nations with a ""take it or leave it"" deal.Progress had ""been held up by Brazil , when it should have been held up by the small islands. It's tragic."" One of the largest disappointments for countries of all wealths and sizes was the lack of ambition to reduce emissions shown in the final COP24 text.Most nations wanted the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to form a key part of future planning.It highlighted the need to slash carbon pollution by nearly half before 2030 in order to hit the 1.5C target. But the US, Saudi Arabia , Russia and Kuwait objected, leading to watered-down wording.The final statement from the Polish COP24 presidency welcomed ""the timely conclusion"" of the report and invited ""parties to make use of it"" -- hardly the ringing endorsement many nations had called for.""There's been a shocking lack of response to the 1.5 report,"" Greenpeace's Morgan, told AFP. ""You can't come together and say you can't do more!"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who made three trips to Katowice over the course of the talks, said the world's climate fight was just beginning.""From now on my five priorities will be: Ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition,"" he said in a message read out by UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa.With the political climate process well into its third decade sputtering on as emissions rise remorselessly, activists have stepped up grassroots campaigns of civil disobedience to speed up action.""We are not a one-off protest, we are a rebellion,"" a spokesman for the Extinction Rebellion movement, which disrupted at least one ministerial event at the COP, told AFP.""We are organising for repeated disruption, and we are targeting our governments, calling for the system change needed to deal with the crisis that we are facing."""
Ambulance driver’s humane touch,2018-12-17,"The inability of a woman to pay for an ambulance that brought home her son’s mortal remains nearly two decades ago struck a deep chord with Pune-based ambulance driver Sanjay Shankar Jagtap He launched a trust called Shuddhidhan Pratishtan in an endeavour to provide free ambulance services to the needy.Over the last 18 years as an ambulance driver, Jagtap has gone out of his way to help many old, ailing and abandoned persons go back to their families and helped police transport accident victims to hospitals.He has played a key role in reuniting nearly 70 abandoned patients with their families, sometimes resorting to threatening the families to take them back.

It moved me so much that I launched my trust for people who cannot pay for these services.”According to Jagtap, while working at Sassoon hospital , he came across social worker MB Shelke. “Shelke told me about abandoned patients. He said he would bear the diesel costs if I started locating the homes of the abandoned patients and ensured that they reached home. I started helping these patients. I have come across several cases wherein patients were abandoned by their families and some cases wherein the patient was assumed dead,” he said.Jagtap can never forget Haribhau Khutwad. “He was from Dapoli and we drove down there and roamed around the town for an entire day in search of his residence. We found out that he had provided us with the wrong address. We were able to identify the house where his son stayed with his in-laws. On reaching the house, the son told us that he will give us the address of their native village where Khutwad should be dropped. On enquiry, I found out that there was no one to support him at his native village. I then threatened his son with a police complaint if he abandoned his father. That was when the son took him back,” Jagtap said.He also remembered an AIDS patient, Hirabai Chorge, who was brought to Sassoon Hospital some years ago after people found her unconscious at Alandi. “She underwent treatment and asked to be taken to her sister’s house. On reaching the sister’s house, she refused to take her, saying that Chorge was survived by her son, daughter and mother-in-law.

"Tamil Nadu: 20,000 teenage pregnancies reported in nine months in Tamil Nadu",2018-12-18,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Civic Issues","CHENNAI: The pregnancy rate of teenage girls in Tamil Nadu is staggering. Officials in the Directorate of Public Health pointed out that 20,000 cases of teenage pregnancies -- below 18 years of age -- were recorded between April and December 12 this year.“The 20,000 number was derived from the registrations made on the Pregnancy and Infant Cohort Monitoring and Evaluation (PICME) database during these months since it is now mandatory for mothers to register under this tool to avail benefits. This is the first time that teenage pregnancies are being extensively documented in the state,” said Darez Ahamed, director, National Health Mission, Tamil Nadu, and Commissioner of Maternal and Child Health.He said the average age group of pregnant girls was between 16 and 18 and most were married. He also added that most of the teens did not opt for abortion “The number is miniscule. But most want to continue their pregnancy. We keep a close watch on them since they are a high-risk group,” he said.However, figures from the department of social welfare and nutritious meal programme revealed that only 6,965 child marriages had been reported and thwarted by district social welfare officers between 2008 and 2018.“There is more of a health crisis than a social one,” said Vidya Reddy, co-founder of Tulir -- Centre for Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse.She said there was a dire need to educate children, especially young girls, about their sexual and reproductive rights.“Unlike boys, how many girls have access to birth control? Where will she go? What will she ask for? As long as you don't give children access to information and access birth control , they will be dependent on boys. Then there is no point talking about this huge number,” she said.A study by the International Institute of Population Studies also highlighted the dire need to educate children in the country about sexual health.It said that there was restricted awareness on topics such as sex and pregnancy, contraceptive methods, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS and the conditions under which abortion was legally available and restricted.T K Shaanthy Gunasingh, a gynecologist and president of the Obstetric and Gynaecological Society of Southern India, highlighted several health risks involved during teenage pregnancy.“Girls at this age are not mentally and physically prepared to have children. And since they are still growing, their bones would not have formed well, which can result in operative deliveries. They are also prone to hypertensive disorders which can be hazardous to both the mother and the baby,” she said.“Education on sexual and reproductive health must be mandatorily provided in all schools,” she added."
West bengal: Women’s panel: No aid for HIV patient,2018-12-18,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Bhubaneswar News,Civic Issues","NEW DELHI: Physical torture of inmates in West Bengal , no medical aid for HIV patient in Odisha and no treatment for mentally-challenged women in Uttar Pradesh were some of the key findings of the women’s commission during inspection of shelter homes in these states.The inquiry committee appointed by the National Commission for Women inspected five Swadhar Greh in West Bengal, eight in Odisha, eight in Karnataka and five in Uttar Pradesh.Out of 26 Swadhar Greh, only one is running as per the guidelines of the scheme, according to the report submitted to the NCW by the inspection committee. These rehabilitation centres were either Centre-funded or NGO-run short-stay homes for the sexually abused and destitute.In Uttar Pradesh, mentally-challenged inmates were found living in these homes but there was no sign of any treatment for them, “who are rolling on the floor at the time of inspection”.In West Bengal, the inmates complained that they are subjected to physical torture by the counselor of the Swadhar Greh. “Seven of the inmates are mentally-challenged women and the Swadhar Greh is like a congested prison. The building, kitchen and rooms are dirty and unhygienic,” the report on the condition of the shelter home in West Bengal said.In Odisha, one inmate with a child, a trafficking case, complained to the committee that she is a HIV patient and the NGO is not providing any medication to her. “Though, she wants to go back to her parents, she was forced to stay back in the Greh by the NGO,” the report said.Women’s commission chairperson Rekha Sharma proposed introduction of a system like uploading the up-to-date data of inmates on the website of women and child development department. pti"

World AIDS Day observed in DMCH,2018-12-02,Ludhiana,"News,City News,Chandigarh News","Ludhiana: World AIDS Day was observed on Saturday in the Medicine OPD of the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). Dean (Academics) Dr Rajoo Singh Chhina addressed the gathering of patients and their attendants present in the OPD. In his message, Dr Chhina said: “With the passage of time, awareness regarding AIDS has increased, and there have been less cases of patients suffering from HIV/AIDS. The main problem prevalent in our society is that there is a lot of social stigma attached to AIDS patients. There are many myths which people follow while dealing with people suffering from AIDS, like avoiding talking to them or shaking hands with them, treating them like social outcasts.”Students from College of Nursing and Para Medical Sciences performed a play in which they beautifully depicted an AIDS awareness programme. Other faculty members present on the occasion included Dr Sunil Kumar Gupta (professor and head of Dermatology), Dr Dinesh Jain (professor of Medicine), Dr Veenu Gupta, Dr Rama Gupta, and Dr Jyoti Chaudhary (all from Department of Microbiology)."
‘Important to know your status via HIV test’,2018-12-02,AURANGABAD,,"AURANGABAD: School and college students participated in a rally themed ‘know your status’ that was conducted by the district civil hospital on Saturday to mark World AIDS Day.A kilometre long foot march was flagged off in the morning from Kranti Chowk and culminated at Marathwada Sanskrutik Mandal Ground in Khadkeshwar. Deputy director of health services Swapnil Lale, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) dean Kanan Yelikar, district civil surgeon Sundar Kulkarni, Maharashtra State Aids Control Society and NGOs working in prevention and control of AIDS participated in the rally.During the rally, participants distributed leaflets raising awareness about AIDS. Students presented street plays to showcase the theme of the rally. “Everybody should know their status by getting undergoing a HIV test. This was the message conveyed through the street play,” said Kulkarni.Speaking to TOI, Kulkarni said the prevalence of AIDS in Aurangabad district was lesser compared to Ahmednagar and Nashik . “There are less than 1% patients with AIDS in Aurangabad. Pilgrim destinations in both the districts were to be blamed for the high prevalence rate of AIDS,” he said adding that the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) continued to undertake frequent drives to screen people involved in travelling jobs and expecting mothers.“If expecting mothers are tested positive during their pregnancy check-ups, we can prevent the infection from being passed on to the child,” said Kulkarni.According to figures provided by DAPCU’s Mangesh Gaikwad, 13,057 persons have tested positive for HIV from 2007 to 2018 but the figure has nosedived significantly over the years.Currently, ART centres at GMCH and at Paithan provide treatment to the affected patients. Kulkarni said the district civil hospital would soon open an ART centre."

Need change of mindset about sex to fight AIDS menace: NGO,2018-12-02,GUWAHATI,"News,City News,Guwahati News,Civic Issues","GUWAHATI: Pancharatna, a local NGO working towards eradication of AIDS, was awarded by the state government for their tireless efforts on the occasion of World AIDS Day on Saturday. Speaking to TOI, the NGO said a change of mindset in talking about sex is necessary to fight the AIDS menace.Since 2008, the NGO has counselled more than 1000 individuals who are MSMs (men who have sex with men) in different locations of Nalbari district. Pancharatna has been bestowed with the responsibility to carry out the Targeted Intervention (TI) project with MSMs and transgenders.Health workers of the NGO have succeeded to persuade 22 MSMs to have health check-ups which detected that they were HIV positive. Fear of being ostracized had been one of the factors that kept the 22 men secretive about their sexual orientation and unable to take preventive measures.“It’s been a very difficult journey over the last 10 years. People still shy away from discussing sex. And the people who are MSM don’t want to speak openly at all. They would always hide. So, it becomes even more difficult to trace them,” Mahendra Baishya, chairman of Pancharatna, told TOI.“After we notice homosexual behaviour, we engage with them by making friends with the help of our workers with similar feelings towards the same sex. That’s how they become open and then we persuade them for blood tests and the next steps,” Baishya added.If anyone is found to be positive, they are immediately sent to the Gauhati Medical College Hospital for further treatment. He said that the age group of these 22 detected positive is from 20 to 35. “Many of them are married but they were continuing unsafe MSM activities. This has also introduced threats for their wives and newborns. This is very dangerous,” said Baishya.Narrating his experiences of the last decade, Baishya said only 30% change has come. “People don’t want to discuss sex openly. Until and unless we change this kind of mindset, we will not be able to fight this menace,” said Baishya.The most effective means of controlling the spread of HIV in India is through the implementation of Targeted Interventions (TIs) amongst persons most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, such as female sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgenders and injecting drug users.As per the India HIV Estimation 2017 Fact Sheet, it is estimated that Assam has 13,539 people living with the disease. HIV prevalence in Assam is 0.06%, lower than the national average, which is 0.22%.“The scenario is not at all pleasant because Assam is vulnerable to new HIV infections mainly because of inflow and outflow of migrants,” said Samir Sinha, principal secretary of health and family welfare department."
Scared villagers drain 36-acre lake after HIV+ woman drowns in it,2018-12-04,Hubballi,"News,City News,Hubballi News","Hubballi: The residents of Morab , around 30km from Hubballi, have refused to drink water from their village lake after an HIV-positive woman committed suicide by jumping into it a week ago. Unable to convince them, the authorities are now draining the water from the 36-acre lake — roughly the size of 25 football fields — which they hope to refill with water from the Malaprabha canal.The Morab lake is the biggest in Navalgund taluk and the only source of drinking water for villagers and cattle. As of now, villagers trek 2-3km to the Malaprabha canal to fetch water.“This is unfortunate. We have been telling people not to panic as HIV does not spread through water. But the people are not convinced and they have started draining out the lake,” said Dharwad district health officer Dr Rajendra Doddamani.Dr Glory Alexander, founder-director of Asha Foundation, which treats HIV+ patients, said it was a case of fear rather than stigma. ""It's sheer ignorance stemming from lack of awareness. When an HIV positive person dies, the virus also dies. Even if the virus comes out of the body, it cannot survive in water and dies in a couple of seconds. There is no risk of infection spreading from the water,"" she said.The body of the woman was found in the lake on November 29. Word immediately spread the water had been contaminated, creating panic. Villagers refused to drink the water and pressured the gram panchayat and the Navalgund taluk administration to drain the lake. Authorities tried to convince the villagers that the water was not contaminated and that they would test the water, but no one relented. The authorities have now deployed 20 siphon tubes with four motors to pump out the water.“We found the body in a highly decomposed state,” said Muttanna Bhavaikatti, from Morab village. “We don’t want to consume contaminated water. We are trekking 2-3km to fetch water from the Malaprabha right bank canal that flows through Morab.”Pradeep Hanikere, another villager, said the daily hardship was preferable to drinking water from the lake. “Do the officials drink bottled water if they find dirt or a speck in it? If they can’t, then how can they force us to drink water from the lake where we found the body of a woman,” he said.Another villager pointed out, “We would have consumed the water if it was the body of a normal person; but the woman died of HIV. There is no other way: The authorities must drain out water and fill it with fresh water to save the lives of villagers.”Gram panchayat member Laxman Patil said the villagers refused to see reason, so pipes have been sucking water out for the past four days. “We managed to drain out lakhs of litres, and discharged the water in a nearby stream. We still have to drain water from 60% of the lake and need at least five days to empty it,” he said. There is another problem, though. “The taluk administration wants us to complete the task by December 6. They have warned the Malaprabha right canal will be closed after December 8, so we have to fill the water into lake before that. More than 50 people are involved in pumping out water. We will need 1-2 weeks to empty and fill the lake.”Navalgund tahsildar Naveen Hullur said: “We tried our best to convince people to drink the lake water but they refused outright. We offered to conduct tests to prove that the water is fit to drink. I will talk to officials to allow us to fill the lake from Malaprabha canal till December 20 or 22.”"

Heptulla was speaking at an event called ‘Know your HIV status’ which was organized at the 1st BN Manipur Rifles’ ground on the occasion of World Aids Day “Undergoing the HIV test is a must as it helps early detection and can pave the way for healthy living. It is the responsibility of the society to take up this fight against the disease,” she said. Adding that the fight against AIDS is also societal, economic and political, the governor expressed hope that experts and intellectuals would come up with suggestions which could help generate more awareness.This is not a battle to be fought by health officials and activists, but civil society groups should also come forward, she said. Appreciating the role of NGOs, Heptulla spoke about the need to spread more awareness about the disease.Chief minister N Biren Singh, who was also present on the occasion, said though the prevalence of AIDS is declining in the state, it is still very common in Manipur. The prevalence rate of HIV in Manipur is 1.43% while the rate is 0.022% in the country. Calling for an end of discrimination against AIDS patients, Biren urged NGOs and the people to come forward to take the fight forward. The government aims to ensure that there are no new HIV cases in Manipur by 2024, he added.Health minister L Jayantakumar said only awareness can put an end to the stigma and discrimination against AIDS patients.

"HIV, TB cases dip among vulnerable sections",2018-12-03,Trichy,"News,City News,Trichy News","Trichy: Despite being considered ‘vulnerable groups’ for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, no new cases have been reported in the recent detection drive conducted by the health department at prisons, oldage homes, rescue and rehabilitation shelters and orphanages in the district.As part of the national initiative, the state government in September had launched detection survey- HIV and TB Intervention in Prisons and other closed settings in Tamil Nadu - for people who fall under vulnerable groups for the two diseases.The detection drive started in Trichy on November 19 and got over on December 1. A total of 1,760 people were covered in the drive including 1,195 from the Trichy central prison and special prison for women and 565 people from orphanages, rescue and rehabilitation shelters and old-age homes, that were zeroed in for the programme.Deputy director of medical services, TB control, Dr S Savithri told TOI that all people with symptoms of tuberculosis were tested during the programme. A total of 115 sputum samples were collected. “We utilised this opportunity to cover the vulnerable groups and no one tested positive for TB. Early intervention is an absolute must for efficient treatment of TB,” she said.Though there were no new TB cases at the prisons, there were a handful of existing TB patients and they were being provided treatment. No existing TB cases were reported in other closed settings and state-run homes.While less prevalence of TB among people detected recently might seem to be positive news, according to health officials, prevalence is still high in Trichy city, Manachanallur, Thuvakudi and Thiruverumbur. So far, this year around 2,800 people were said to have received treatment for treatment in the whole district.On the other hand, all adults among the covered population were made to undergo the HIV/AIDS test. “Unlike TB, HIV/ AIDS does not show early symptoms. In some cases, it may take seven to ten years for symptoms to show. That’s why all the adults were tested,” District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), S Martin Manivannan said. Though there were no new cases, around seven to 10 HIV/ AIDS patients were inmates at the prisons and none in the other closed settings.Manivannan said that no positive HIV/ AIDS cases was evidence for how much the disease has decreased in Trichy. “Compared to the prevalence rate of 1.91% in 2011, the prevalence is just 0.37% now. Detection drives like the recent ones show how much AIDS has been curbed in the district,” he said."

TB among AIDS patients coming down: Health officials,2018-12-09,Trichy,"News,City News,Trichy News","Trichy: The occurrence of tuberculosis (TB) among HIV/ AIDS patients – which could potentially be dangerous – has decreased significantly over the past three years in Trichy district, health officials said here on Saturday. They said that compared to more than 300 cases of TB reported in 2016, only around 140 had been reported this year so far.The officials were speaking at an HIV/ AIDS awareness session at the collectorate held as part of observing World AIDS Day (which fell on December 1). They pointed out that while the mortality rate among patients suffering from only HIV/AIDS is less, it goes up to around 18% to 20% when they also have the comorbid condition of TB. While the total number of TB cases among HIV/AIDS patients was 303 in 2016, it came down to 230 in 2017. Deputy director of medical services, TB control, Dr S Savithri said, “Around 1,761 HIV/AIDS patients this year were tested for TB out of which the result showed positive for 140 people.” She added that this decrease would also aid in reduced mortality due to TB among HIV/ AIDS patients in future.An official from the health department told TOI that the decrease in the number of TB cases was because the infection chain was effectively broken. “Since 2015, we’ve got the technology through which we could detect TB among people three months early. Early identification helps in breaking the infective chain,” the official added. Cartridge-based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT) which helps in detecting TB early was installed at KAP Viswanatham Government Medical College a few years ago.District collector K Rajamani, who presided over the event, spoke about how the prevalence of HIV/AIDS itself has reduced in Trichy. “When it comes to the prevalence of HIV/ AIDS overall, compared to 18 HIV/AIDS patients in every 1,000 population in 2010, it has come down to around four per 1,000 currently,” he said. While the overall decrease in prevalence might be a positive news, the collector said that based on the information that he received, HIV/ AIDS was increasing at an alarming rate among unmarried youths in the district and that enough awareness measures should be taken to address this issue."

So, even as the world celebrated doomsayers, Pinker used hard data and unacademic prose in his latest book ‘Enlightenment Now",News,"It is a terrible time to be an optimist. But Steven Pinker , a Harvard professor and cognitive psychologist, can’t help it. Not too long ago, when this Canadian-American decided to set aside newspapers and look at quantitative trends, he realised that our lives are much healthier, wealthier and freer than before. So, even as the world celebrated doomsayers, Pinker used hard data and unacademic prose in his latest book ‘Enlightenment Now: The Case for Science, Reason, Humanism and Progress’ to give us a sunny view of humanity’s progress. He tells Sharmila Ganesan Ram that Indians are actually more optimistic than people in wealthier nations.Most people, in fact, are optimistic about their own lives — while saying that the world is getting worse. That must be because they get their view of the world from news. News is about what happens, like wars, epidemics, and terrorist attacks, not about what doesn’t happen, like peace, health, and safety. No matter how many regions of the world are at peace, as long as wars and murders and diseases continue to exist, there will always be enough of them to fill the news, and people’s perception will be disconnected from reality. Only by looking at data — which count up all the events, all the countries, all the lives — can you get a true sense of the direction of the world.Together with the inherent nature of news, which focuses on events rather than trends, many journalists believe that it’s their mission to highlight disasters and crises and corruption, and that reporting what goes right is selling out — it’s government propaganda, they tell me, or corporate public relations. And, they say, it’s important to present a distorted picture of the world (they don’t put it quite that way) to prevent people from becoming complacent. I think this is nonsense. An accurate understanding of the world has to include an awareness of problems, of course, but it also has to include an awareness of solutions, or else people will become cynical and fatalistic, figuring that the world just gets worse and worse no matter what people do, so we might as well enjoy ourselves while we can.Yes, the brain is wired for nostalgia: with the passage of time, we forget how bad the bad events in our past were. And yes, I am tired about hearing how past decades were better. The 1980s, for example, were a decade when Eastern Europe, East Asia, and Latin America were ruled by dictatorships, when wars raged throughout Africa, Central America , and the Middle East (including a war between Iran and Iraq that killed more than half a million people), an epidemic of AIDS, homosexuality illegal in most countries, far higher rates of murder and rape in most countries… I could go on.The section on Trump is far from happy, nor are the discussions of climate change and the risk of nuclear war. Understanding human progress is not a question of being “happy” or “sad.” It’s a question of knowing the facts. The facts are that we’re living longer, safer, better educated, and more peaceful lives. These facts do not mean that the world is free of problems, but they do suggest that problems can be solved if we try to solve them.Actually, Indians, on average, do believe that things are getting better: 74% of them, according to a recent Ipsos-MORI poll. Indians are more optimistic than people in wealthy Western countries like those in Europe, North America, and Oceania.Data from India is discussed in more than forty places in the book, which document many areas in which it has progressed since Independence, including reductions in war deaths, famine deaths, extreme poverty, and illiteracy. I was surprised to learn that the per-capita income in India today is the same as that of Sweden in 1920, though it has a hundred times as many people. I was also surprised to see that Indians are among the world’s least tolerant people: compared to other countries, people in India are less likely to say that it’s important for people of different races, ethnicities, and religions to be treated equally, and to endorse full equality for men and women. Still, a majority of Indians endorse these ideas — just smaller minorities than in other countries.Steven Pinker will be speaking at the Times Litfest which will be held in Mumbai’s Mehboob Studios from December 14 to 16"
"Drive detects over 2: Drive detects over 2,000 ‘hidden’ TB patients in Maharashtra",2018-12-06,PUNE,"News,City News,Pune News,Civic Issues","PUNE: As many as 2,057 individuals have been identified with active tuberculosis (TB) during the mass community screening campaign conducted in the state’s 36 districts.An intensive door-to-door campaign to detect unreported TB cases across the state was kicked off on November 12 and continued up to November 24. The state health department screened roughly 86 lakh high-risk individuals in both rural and urban areas during the second phase of the campaign. Around 10,000 health workers and community volunteers were engaged in the screening activity.“After identifying 2,057 patients with active TB, we put them on treatment. The proportion of TB cases identified during these campaigns may appear to be on the lower side, but such drives are crucial for early detection and breaking the chain of TB infection transmission,” said Padmaja Jogewar, joint director (TB) at the state health department.High-risk individuals living in urban slums, orphanages as well as street dwellers, construction-site workers, former TB patients, HIV-infected persons, diabetics and the malnourished population were mainly among those who were screened for TB.The active “case finding” campaign began in the state last year with three door-to-door campaigns, which led to the diagnosis of 4,000 “hidden” patients in the community.This is the second such campaign this year. In the first campaign held across the state in January, health officials had detected 1,600 new TB patients.“The drives help in educating people and creating mass awareness about TB in the community,” said Sanjeev Kamble, a senior public health expert and director of the state health department.The fight against TB has intensified in Maharashtra with the involvement of NGOs, who are working closely with private practitioners to find “missing” or “hidden” TB patients and put them on treatment, while ensuring their confidentiality.The project, for which a public-private partnership pact was signed last month, is a part of the Union government’s large-scale drive to identify 15 lakh missing patients across the country in the next three years. It is already operational in 13 municipal corporations in the state, including Pune. However, it will be formally launched in Maharashtra on December 15 this year.The project, Joint Effort for Elimination of Tuberculosis (JEET), aims at speeding up the process of finding, treating and tracking every TB patient in the community till s/he is cured. “It is essential to diagnose and treat missing TB cases to achieve the target of eliminating the disease from the country by 2025,” Jogewar said.Undiagnosed and mistreated cases continue to drive the epidemic in India.

‘Focus is on safe sex and overall development of CSWs’,2018-12-09,"In 1999, when the then collector Manu Kumar Shrivastava revived the Indian Red Cross Society (IRSC) in Nagpur in collaboration with Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society, high instances of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) was a burning issue. 19 years down the line, there has been a drastic reduction in the number of cases, says Dr RP Singh , the secretary of the IRCS’S Nagpur Chapter.As December is celebrated as AIDS awareness month, Dr Singh, who is also the head of department at GMC’s skin department, shared his observations on the current scenario and ideas on how health situation among commercial sex workers can further be improved.Excerpts from the interview...Q. How different was the health scene in commercial sex workers 19 years ago?A. In the 90s, when I used to work at Mayo hospital, we used to treat about 20-30 patients with STDs every month. People used to think it was a curse. We used to distribute condoms by going to sex workers’ homes and make them understand that diseases are being transmitted through their clients. Initially, we conducted camps almost every day. We would enquire about their health continuously. Even today, we keep tracking diseases among sex workers and refer them to the nearest hospital. However, awareness among them has increased. While instances of STDs have gone down, cases of HIV too have decreased. Initially, we used to give them a condom, now they come and collect it themselves. They are doing it on their own, we don’t force anything. 1.5 lakh condoms are given by us every month, and our aim is to make health activities self-sustainable.Q. Can you describe the psyche of women working in city’s red-light area?A. There are approximately 3,500 sex workers in ‘Ganga Jamuna’. It is a floating population. Sometimes they may feel bored or fed up, other times, they are transferred when they start having repeated customers in order to avoid any love affair. Most of the are from Agra, Pune, Chhattisgarh, MP, Rajasthan and Nepal. Not all sex workers want to be rescued. They take it as a profession and many of their children have chosen careers of teachers or lawyers.Q. What is your opinion on The Immoral Traffic (Suppression) Act (SITA)?A. I feel, what is the point of regulations if they are not going to be implemented? Commercial sex is the oldest profession in the world. The more it remains hidden, the more problems arise. There are more workers spread in the city, than those who stay at Ganga Jamuna. Just as liquor and cigarette sells, so does commercial sex. Channels for commercial sex must be kept open, just like in many other countries where it has not posed much problem. In fact, in such countries, sex workers undergo month health check-ups and are given certificates. The Netherlands is the only country which offers education for commercial sex. Like late Atal Bihari Vajpayee says, we don’t need discipline, we need self-discipline.Q. How can health among commercial sex workers be improved?A. Infections will be kept at bay only when condoms are used properly, at a proper time and with proper disposal. Not just correct knowledge, but the right attitude and practice inculcated in them will go a long way. Many years ago, in Africa, big posters urging citizens to use mosquito-nets were printed. However, the concept flopped. When asked, a common African said, ‘Our area does not have mosquitoes as big as the ones shown in the poster.’ It is important to analyse if the message is being passed on clearly and feedback is an effective tool. Partners of those affected should also be checked, as they maybe the source of the infection or the recipient. When we find one person affected with three, there is a probability of discovering two more patients close to them. A study done by Red Cross Society reveals that seven people can be affected by the infection passed through one person. Every day, nearly 20,000 people visit the area. Imagine how risky unsafe sex could be.Q. What are the other works done by IRCS in the red-light area?A. We don’t just focus on the concept of safe sex, but for overall development. We have helped them with Aadhaar card, ration card, bank accounts. We have helped turn gravel paths to cemented lanes by involving corporators. We have looked after problems in the schools among other things and we take interest in improving their social life. We have trained persons from the community to look after health activities and report to us. We have created these groups area-wise, locality wise and in accordance with their background and mother tongue.",,"In 1999, when the then collector Manu Kumar Shrivastava revived the Indian Red Cross Society (IRSC) in Nagpur in collaboration with Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society, high instances of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) was a burning issue. 19 years down the line, there has been a drastic reduction in the number of cases, says Dr RP Singh , the secretary of the IRCS’S Nagpur Chapter.As December is celebrated as AIDS awareness month, Dr Singh, who is also the head of department at GMC’s skin department, shared his observations on the current scenario and ideas on how health situation among commercial sex workers can further be improved.Excerpts from the interview...Q.

Woman who contracted HIV via blood transfusion to get best treatment,2018-12-27,MADURAI,"News,City News,Madurai News","MADURAI: The government has announced that the best medical care will be provided to the pregnant woman who became HIV positive after a blood transfusion at the government hospital in Sivakasi.Speaking to reporters in Madurai and Virudhunagar, after carrying out an enquiry at the Sivakasi government hospital, health secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan said great injustice had been done to the woman and her family. “A preliminary inquiry has revealed that it was due to technical error and negligence, and three persons who were found to be responsible initially have been removed from service,’’ he said.He said that he had spoken to the husband of the affected woman, and he had just three requests - one that his wife be given the best medical attention, that she be shifted out of Virudhunagar, and that the state government should ensure that no other person is affected due to such negligence. The woman is expected to give birth by the end of January 2019.Radhakrishnan said a team of doctors, including Dr Shanthi, Dr Natarajan and Dr Ranjith, had been assigned to attend to the woman exclusively and recheck all parameters as per protocol.The man who donated the blood had tested positive for HIV when he came to the Sattur government hospital blood bank in 2016. But, as the Integrated counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) had not informed him about his condition, he donated the blood at the same hospital on November 30. The woman was given the infected blood when she came for an antinatal check and the Sivakasi government hospital found her anaemic. Radhakrishnan said details of blood donation are computerised, and it would be ascertained how this man was not monitored.Three employees - a councillor with the ICTC, a lab technician and another person - who have not been named have been terminated from service.Dr Radhakrishnan said that eight lakh units of blood was donated in Tamil Nadu annually, and it was given to 12 lakh persons, as different components. The blood was screened for five tests - HIV, hepatis B and C, malaria and syphilis. There was no need for the public to panicThe Sattur town police on Wednesday registered an FIR against unknown nurses and doctors. The case was registered under the Section 269 of the IPC - negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life - and 338 - causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others.Virudhunagar district superintendent of police M Rajarajan said they will take action against those who are found guilty, based on the report from medical experts.The victim, accompanied by her husband, visited the Sattur police station in the morning to lodge the complaint.The woman’s husband said higher authorities in the health department had threatened him when he tried lodge a complaint with the police.Meanwhile, the teenager whose HIV positive blood was transfused to a pregnant woman has attempted suicide by consuming poison. He has been rushed to Ramanathapuram government hospital. The 19-year-old from Thirusiluviyapuram village near Kamuthi worked in a fireworks manufacturing unit in Sivakasi.

"Jail authorities, ART centre pass the buck",2018-12-12,Ludhiana,"News,City News,Chandigarh News","Ludhiana: Two days after the death of an HIV-positive prisoner, the Ludhiana Central Jail authorities and Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) Centre are playing blame game over treatment to the virus-infected inmates.The jail authorities said over the past one year, the centre did not get any of the HIV-positive inmates tested to start their treatment. As a result, they were not taking any medicines. The centre project officer, on the other hand, claimed that they were getting tests conducted as well as providing medicines to inmates free of cost.A 38-year-old HIV-positive prisoner had died at civil hospital in Old City on December 9, a day after his admission.Jail officials said besides being HIV positive, the deceased prisoner had tuberculosis and Hepatitis C, too. While his family claimed that he did not get “proper treatment” in the prison, jail superintendent Shamsher Singh Boparai said they did everything they could.There are 130 HIV-positive prisoners in Ludhiana Central Jail. “Of these, 127 are waiting for their CD4 test from the past one year,” said Boparai. For being administered medicines, the patients have to undergo the CD4 test. It measures the number of CD4 cells in the blood, and the immunity of the patient. With the help of this test, the doctor decides the treatment course. Anti-retroviral therapy centres, which come under National Aids Control Organisation, conduct this test and provide medicines free of cost.The centre project officer, Dr Simran Wander, said, “The jail authorities’ claims are baseless. Representatives of an NGO associated with the centre are deployed in the jail laboratory. They keep a record of the virus-infected patients and regularly get all tests conducted to ensure timely treatment of inmates.”Boparai, however, said, “Only two employees of the NGO sit in the laboratory and keep the medical record. Apart from that, they do nothing. No treatment is being provided to the 127 prisoners. The three others are paying for medicines from their own pockets.”“First, it is the responsibility of the jail to get inmates’ tests conducted and start their treatment. If it is short of funds, then the centre has to step in for HIV-positive patients,” he added.Punjab Aids Control Society project officer Manpreet Chattwal could not be contacted despite repeated attempts."
Blood banks in Trichy district to be checked soon,2018-12-28,Trichy,"News,City News,Trichy News","Trichy: Blood banks in Trichy would be under the district health department’s radar and widespread inspections are to be conducted in a few days. The health department’s move follows the incident in which the blood of an HIV positive youth was transfused to a pregnant woman at a government hospital in Sivakasi.District health department officials said that though there had never been any incidence or claim of negligence in blood donation/ transfusion any time in the recent past, considering the latest incident, they would conduct inspections as a precautionary measure. “Not only this, all blood bank officials have been called for a sensitization meeting by the health department on Friday afternoon,” Joint director of health services (JDHS) Trichy Dr S Samsath Begum told TOI. In Trichy district, there are 13 blood banks out of which two belong to the government.According to the officials, it would be ascertained as to how many of the donated blood samples were screened positive for certain diseases and what was done with the blood after that. “The history of blood donors and volunteers, how many blood transfusion reactions and blood transfused infections were reported would be thoroughly checked too,” an official from the health department said.Officials said that inspections at private blood banks would be given extra-emphasis since they were monitored only once every two months.The diseases that are screened for in the donated blood are HIV/ AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Syphilis and Malaria. According to Trichy programme manager of District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), Dr S Martin Manivannan, if screening showed positive for any of the diseases, the donated blood would be discarded even if further subsequent tests for the particular donor proved to be negative for a certain disease.“In Trichy, only rarely have we screened positive for HIV with the blood donated by a person. In 2015, a person from Manapparai who donated blood was suspected with HIV during screening and later tests confirmed it and the person is undergoing treatment now,” he added."
Lack of funds restricting MSM project,2018-12-09,NAGPUR,"News,City News,Nagpur News","NAGPUR: Men Having Sex With Men (MSM), a targeted intervention project started in Nagpur in 2008 and supported by Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society, has reached 1,500 population of MSM and transgenders.The actual count of such people in the city is five times higher, but the project has been restricted due to lack of funds, said project director Anand Chandrani.“Earlier, funds used to be available for advocacy and awareness through government supported by international organizations. However, other organizations have withdrawn, and the burden has shifted to the government, which anyway has minimal budget for health,” Chandrani said.“Hence, no survey or studies are being conducted despite the need for separate counselling projects for gay, transgenders and bisexuals as all of them have different needs,” he said.The number of MSMs on gay dating sites and social networking platforms is huge. Earlier, such men were found in cozying spots such as Kasturchand Park.“We had identified 30 spots in Nagpur where the community used to come and meet for either hookups, friendships, time pass or sexual encounters. We used to distribute condoms, refer them to doctors and recommend them for HIV testing. However, such spots are drying up because of hooligans, police, stigma and erstwhile section 377,” he said.In Nagpur, the project has been divided area-wise into two groups since the past three years and has been handed over to Sarathi trust and Mumbai’s Gaurav Trust.“Sarathi looks after Sitabuldi, Gandhibagh and east Nagpur areas, whereas Kasturchand Park and areas of west Nagpur come under the purview of Gaurav Trust,” said Chandrani, founder of Sarathi trust.Awareness regarding HIV/AIDS, condom distribution, screening and counselling for men who have sex with men is the agenda of this project. It includes gays, bisexuals and transgenders, and Sarathi has found 89 HIV positive cases from cases registered under them.“We have identified 1,450 MSMs and 50 transgenders under this project. Previously, under a project called Pehchan supported by Global Fund, we had registered 2,500 people. After it was over, we requested MSACS to transfer these people to MSM project so that services can be continued, but due to unavailability of budget, we have not been able to do it,” said Chandrani.Presently, MSM project has been allotted five outreach workers, 1 accountant, 1 officer, 1 project manager and a counsellor along with part-time peer educators. “If we increase the target, we will need double staff and double salary,” said Chandrani, adding that the annual budget for the project is Rs25 lakh."

Morab villagers begin to refill lake with canal water,2018-12-13,HUBBALLI,"News,City News,Hubballi News","HUBBALLI: People of Morab in Navalgund taluk of Dharwad district who had refused to drink water from the village’s lake after finding the body of a HIV positive woman in it, completely drained the lake on Tuesday evening.Villagers started the process of refilling the lake with water from the Malaprabha Right canal on Wednesday. The 36-acre Morab lake is one of the biggest lakes in district and is the only source of drinking water for the villagers.It is said that the woman had committed suicide by jumping into the lake last week and her body was found on November 29. Villagers stopped drinking water from the lake from that day itself, fearing that the water was contaminated.Morab gram panchayat member Laxman Patil told TOI that the lake was the only source of drinking water, villagers had refused to drink the water and had demanded authorities to drain the lake and fill it with fresh water.The authorities buckled under pressure and started draining the lake last week. “We deployed four motors and 20 six-inch pipes to pump out water from the lake on November 30. We took nearly 10 days to completely empty the lake,” said Patil.Basavaraj Melavanki, GP water man of Morab said, “Villagers are still fetching water from Malaprabha right canal by trekking 1-2 km daily. They have remained adamant and have not even touched the lake water. More than 50 persons were involved in the task of pumping out water from the lake.”“On Tuesday evening we completely emptied the lake and started the process of refilling it on Wednesday morning. We had discharged the water to a nearby stream. Some villagers used this water for their fields. Now, water is flowing into the lake from the Malaprabha right canal and it will take about 5-6 days to refill it,” added Melavanki.Navalgund tahsildar Naveen Hullur said, “When all our efforts to convince the villagers about using the lake water went in vain, we extended our full support to the villagers to drain the lake. Once the lake is filled in a few days, villagers can start consuming the like before.”Villagers have now appealed to the GP and taluk administration to depute one or two security guards at the lake to prevent people from jumping in to the water to commit suicide and contaminate the water.MLA Shankar Patil Munenkoppa has already demanded the district administration to deploy security guards at Morab lake and other waterbodies in the district to avoid a similar situation, during a recent drought review meeting in Hubballi."

US Senate passes bill to avert shutdown,2018-12-20,WASHINGTON,"News,World News,US News","WASHINGTON: The US Senate has approved a legislation to temporarily fund the government in an effort to avoid a partial shutdown just before Christmas after President Donald Trump backed away from his demand for money for a border wall with Mexico Senators on Wednesday passed the measure, which would keep government running to 8 February.The House of Representatives needs to pass similar bill to avoid a government shutdown this weekend. House, in which the Republicans currently has a majority, is expected to pass the bill, but unlikely to include funding for the border wall.Unless the issue is resolved, more than 800,000 federal workers would face furloughs or be forced to work without pay, disrupting government operations days before Christmas.Democratic Leader and Speaker-designate, Nancy Pelosi , said her party would support the bill to avert government shutdown. The House is likely to pass the bill on Thursday, before it heads to the President Donald Trump to sign it into law.Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with top congressional Democratic leaders last week that he would be ""proud"" to shut down part of the government in service of forcing Congress to give him the full $5 billion he wants for a border wall.The administration appeared to soften its stance on Tuesday when White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Fox News , ""At the end of the day we don't want to shut down the government.""The border wall was central to Trump's presidential campaign.""The American people know the president's wall is ineffective, expensive, and only serves as a political bone to his most conservative supporters – certainly not worth a government shutdown,"" Senator Chuck Schumer , Senate Minority Leader, said.""It's good that Republicans in the Senate finally realised that they should not shut down the government over a wall that does not have enough support to pass the House or Senate and is not supported by a majority of the country,"" Schumer said.""It is unfortunate that Trump's demand for a border wall from sea to shining sea has held up seven appropriations bills that have been debated and passed out of committee on a bipartisan basis,"" said Senator Dick Durbin."

"Christmas celebrated with much fervour, gaiety",2018-12-25,Coimbatore,"News,City News,Coimbatore News","Coimbatore: People celebrated Christmas in the city by thronging churches for the traditional midnight mass on Monday.Devotion was at its peak while singing traditional hymns, taking holy communion, and listening to the familiar story about the Christmas’ origin, meaning and history.Youngsters, who preferred listening to the English service, attended Christmas special mass on Tuesday morning and participated in festivities. Besides the church visits, most Coimbatorians celebrated the festival by sharing traditional Christmas treats with family members and relatives.Thousands of people, including non-Christians and even irregular churchgoers, attended the traditional midnight mass at the city’s historic and well-known churches like the Resurrection Church, All Souls Church, St Josephs, CSI Immanuel Church, among others. The churches were decorated with serial lights and a large Christmas tree.“The midnight mass at the All Souls Church included singing of many hymns, listening to a reflective message and the story of Christmas,” said Herbert Prince. “The midnight mass is special because it is attended by many children who live abroad or don’t come to church regularly, but attend this particular mass,” he said. “It is nice to meet them after a long time and catch up,” he added.The morning mass too which starts at around 10am is considered special because people get to meet their relatives and cousins. “It is one day in the year when most of our relatives and children attend church. So, you get to meet all of them and chat, which does not happen often in our busy lifestyle,” disco jockey Carlyle D’Silva said.Most Christian homes saw their dining tables filled with traditional Christmas treats like Kalkand, plum cake which is made with fruits soaked almost three months ago, wine, Dhol, rose cookies and turkey.“My wife’s Christmas treats include Burmese dish called Sanwin Makin. It is a popular dish. She distributes the dish at YWCA, senior citizen’s homes, HIV afflicted children etc., to spread joy,” said Prince.“But the point is to spend time with family. So, the whole family gets together at someone’s house for lunch to catch up. We visit our other family members the rest of the day to exchange wishes and sweets,” said A Fernandez, a resident of Podanur.Many people also enjoyed a late but heavy breakfast including non-vegetarian dishes before they went visiting relatives."
"Transgender Persons Bill: 'Need equality, not rehabilitation': Why the Transgender Persons Bill fails the community",2018-12-20,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016, which was hurriedly passed by a voice vote amid din in the Lok Sabha on Monday has come under the scanner for being regressive and discriminatory towards the Trans-community. The bill was passed with 27 amendments that were recommended to the proposed draft bill.Despite multiple interventions by the community, the bill failed to include measures which are necessary to make society more inclusive, since the community has long been shunned and denied job opportunities. Furthermore, the bill criminalises ‘begging’, which has long been the primary source of income for major constituents of the community. Hence, the bill effectively takes away their source of living without providing a sure alternative.In addition, some say the bill violates the Supreme Court’s landmark National Legal Services Authority judgment of 2014, which recognised the right of transgender persons to identify their own gender.A transgender person was, as per the original definition in the bill introduced earlier, ‘“neither wholly female nor wholly male; or a combination of female or male; or neither female nor male; and whose sense of gender does not match with the gender assigned to that person at the time of birth, and includes trans men and trans women, persons with intersex variations and gender-queers.”But the definition was later amended to read - “a person whose gender does not match with the gender assigned to that person at birth and includes trans-man or trans-woman (whether or not such person has undergone Sex Reassignment Surgery or hormone therapy or laser therapy or such other therapy), person with intersex variations, gender-queer and person having such socio-cultural identities as kinner, hijra, aravani and jogta.” Transgender community protesting against the bill in Bengaluru.While the second definition is clearer, it isn’t without its own set of confusing statements. ""Gender is a construct, and an internalised identity. Hence it would make more sense to state that for a Transgender person, ‘’their sense of gender doesn’t match the gender assigned to them at birth’’. Why do I need someone to affirm my gender? Why are we medicalising the process?’’ argues Abhina Aher, associate director: Sexuality, Gender & Rights at India HIV/AIDS AllianceAbhina adds - ""The bill assumes that an intersex person is a Transgender. This is not true. Any intersex person is free to identify with the gender assigned to them at birth, or can alternatively choose to identify as a Transgender. To impose an identity on them is illiberal and coercive.’’To be identified as a transgender, a person has to get a certificate of identity from the district magistrate, which will be issued on the basis of recommendations made by a District Screening Committee, consisting of a chief medical officer, a psychologist or psychiatrist and an officer nominated by the government, a member of the transgender community and a district social welfare officer.As aforementioned, the bill takes away a transgender person’s right to self-identify, an aspect which was the cornerstone of the NALSA judgement. ‘’It (the bill)enforces our identification to be subject to screening, which could be a harrowing experience, considering the discrimination faced by us in the society at present. I am at their mercy,’’ Abhina argues.Keeping in view the often harrowing experiences faced by the community, it would’ve been prudent to provide for them reservation in jobs and education. But this is not the case, much to the chagrin of the Trans-community. Furthermore, begging has been criminalised, and the bill prescribes a jail term of six months to two years for anyone who makes any transgender person beg. This is in variance with the practices of the Hijra gharana, which has for eons been seeking alms by going from door to door. The community feels the bill impinges on their customs and seeks to alter their mode of living without guaranteeing inclusivity in the society.Abhina speaks about how the bill does not take into account ‘adopted families’ and only talks about birth families. Many transgenders have a Master and Disciple relationship, that is essential to their traditional way of life. The bill does not take into account traditional businesses and only highlights mainstream professions that the community can, or should partake in. It effectively delegitimizes transgender community ties.Referring to the clause in the Bill that states how the State will ensure the “rescue, protection and rehabilitation” of transgender persons, Abhina opines that “trans people do not need rehabilitation, they need equality and empowerment.”Another major problem area for the community is that the demand for robust anti-discrimination clauses and proportionate penalties for sexual offences committed against transgender persons, in line with section 375-376 of the IPC was unheeded. Clauses 3 (prohibition of discrimination) and 19 (offences and penalties) of the Bill were passed without any changes.As a result, there is no effective remedy for discrimination and sexual violence will be treated like a ‘petty crime’, punishable with six months to two years imprisonment — thereby clearly violating the constitutional guarantee of equality before law, says Abhina. “Our call for a gender-neutral law with respect to rape laws has not been answered. There is no justice if a trans-woman is raped, within the law. It is discriminatory and devoid of equality.The Bill does not refer to important civil rights like marriage and divorce, adoption, etc., which are critical to transgender persons’ lives.’’With only four MPs addressing the debate which lasted less than the time allotted of two hours, the community’s perception is that there is no tone of support in the entire bill. Whether it will be passed by the Rajya Sabha or not, or will popular dissent force the government to rethink its approach, is for time to tell."

There are already 640 red ribbon clubs in the colleges and we will set up 50 more. Similarly, we have received proposal from nine jails in different parts of the state to conduct our sensitisation activities,” said Patnaik.According to official data, the state has recorded 46,246 positive cases of HIV-AIDS from 2012 to September 2018 with 1,514 deaths. The vulnerable districts, when it comes to number of HIV positive cases, are Ganjam with 15,034 positive cases followed by Cuttack with 6,264 cases.The analysis of OSACS on the vulnerability of the diseases over the years further revealed that HIV-AIDS is prevalent among age group of 25 to 49 at 77% followed by the age group of 15 to 24 at 9%. Besides, sexual intercourse is found to be a major route of transmission of the disease at 88% followed by infected syringes at 2%."

Tamil Nadu news: Pregnant woman turns HIV positive after blood transfusion,2018-12-26,MADURAI,"News,City News,Madurai News","MADURAI: Three health workers of a blood bank at the government hospital in Sivakasi have been placed under suspension for not screening a blood sample which was HIV positive leading to its transfusion to a pregnant woman at the Sattur government hospital.Dr R Manoharan, joint director of health services, Virudhunagar, said that on November 30, a relative of a patient at the Sivakasi government hospital had donated blood for the patient’s requirement. The technicians at the laboratory screened the blood that was donated and labelled it safe. However, since the patient’s requirement was met from the blood bank, the donated blood was stored.On December 3, this was transfused to an anaemic, pregnant woman .The donor had to go for a blood test at a private laboratory in Virudhunagar as his job appointment abroad required it. The lab report showed him HIV positive and having jaundice . Doubtful of the report, the man approached the Sivakasi government hospital, where a new test confirmed his HIV positive status. Manoharan was informed and there was an immediate search for the donated blood, which they found had been transfused to the pregnant woman. The woman was summoned to the hospital and tests which showed that she had been infected with HIV.It has now come to light that the Sattur government hospital had first found the donor HIV positive in 2016 during a blood donation camp. Instead of conveying it to him directly, he was told he had a rare blood group and was asked to come to the hospital.""It should no have happened. We have initiated technical inquiries to find out how it happened. This will not be repeated again. We want to ensure this doesn't happen again,"" said Dr K Senthil Raj, project director, Tamil NaduAids Control Society.Meanwhile, the HIV positive donor and the pregnant woman, who is expected to give birth in a month, have been given counselling and put on antiretroviral (ARV), a drug that prevents a retro virus from replicating."

1st clinical trial in haemophilia gene editing to take place in 2019,2018-12-22,Hyderabad,"News,BUSINESS NEWS,India Business News","Hyderabad: Serial entrepreneur Vijay Chandru, who is on the research council of the Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore’s Centre For Stem Cell Research, on Friday said that the first clinical trial in gene editing in haemophilia is expected to take place in the country in 2019.“Gene editing is a very powerful technology as over 50 million people live in India today with Mendelian rare diseases and many of these are in some sense... theoretically amenable to genome editing which would cure them…I am working with CMC Vellore group to bring about a first trial in haemophilia which will probably happen in 2019,” he said while participating in a panel discussion at the ‘Conclave on Managing Disruptive Technologies’ organised by the Institute of Management Technology (IMT) and Cerebra Skills Academy Pvt Ltd.While disruption in the area of gene editing is already taking place in the world, the major challenge lies the absence of regulatory mechanisms as well as the fact that it is very expensive in nature.He pointed out that it would cost anywhere between $2-4 million to get a gene edited, which means it won’t be accessible to many in its current form.Recently, a Chinese researcher, He Jiankui, of Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, claimed that he had altered the genes of twin girls so they would not contract HIV.While Chandru rooted for a proper regulatory framework for gene editing, he said it would be beneficial in many areas such as plants that would be able to generate more oxygen or microbes that would clean up the environment."

Though it will take some more time to change the mindset of the majority, the scraping of Section 377 has started showing its affects,” said Rubina, a transgender working with the CSACS as a counsellor.There are 153 such transgenders in the city as recorded under the project of CSACS. “The scrapping of the section is benefiting the transgenders as most of them are seeking admission in universities and colleges. They are disclosing their gender by marking against the third option — others,” said Sandeep Mittal, deputy director, target interventions, CSACS.Rubina draws a regular salary under the project and goes to the PGI to counsel her community about HIV tests. “Soon after the decriminalization of Section 377, I was selected for this project. I got many queries after getting this job as my friends wanted to enhance their education and get a job like I have,” said Rubina.The high risk group for HIV include female sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM), and transgenders and injecting drug users. For the overall reduction in HIV, the experts aim to effect behavioural patterns through raising awareness among the high risk groups. According to the CSACS data for the year 2018 until September, 442 were found to be positive.“Also, we see that transgenders are also changing their views about society now. They do not allow anyone to enter their ‘dera’ unless prior approval is taken from the ‘dera’ head. But now there is some flexibility in this,” said Tapan Singh who is working in the transgender project with CSACS."
Lack of malaria test kits hits blood bank at Patna hospital,2019-01-02,PATNA,"News,City News,Patna News","PATNA: Lack of malaria test kits may result in blood crisis at 24X7 blood bank at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH). According to sources, the blood bank has been running short of malaria test kits since December 17. As a result, processing of blood has stopped at the blood bank. One piece of malaria test kit costs between Rs 20 and Rs 25.Medical experts said once a person donates blood, it undergoes five mandatory tests – malaria, HIV, hepatitis-B and C and VDRL. Even ELISA test is mandatory before the blood is infused to another person.City-based social activist Mukesh Hissariya, who organises blood donation camps, said, “Once blood is donated, it can be kept for 35 days. However, platelets can be used only within five days of donation. Hence, if the donated blood is not processed at the PMCH soon, they will be of no use.”PMCH sources said though blood is available at the blood bank, those needing platelets are being returned due to lack of malaria test kits. On an average, about four people require platelet at the health facility.Sources said around 800 units of unprocessed blood are presently kept in the blood bank at PMCH.The blood bank also lacks required manpower. Of the eight sanctioned posts for doctors, only three are filled. All six posts of nurses are vacant. Besides, there are only 10 laboratory technicians against the sanctioned strength of 18.PMCH superintendent Dr Raniv Ranjan Prasad said the malaria test kits were in the hospital, but could not be used as the clerk in charge of store had been transferred to Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS).“The keys of the storeroom are with the clerk. I will hold a meeting to discuss the issue on Wednesday,” Dr Prasad added.Lack of blood or platelets is not new for this premier government hospital of the state. The hospital was running short of platelets even in October last year when there was a dengue outbreak in the city."

The number of cases was the third highest annual figure in history.Data available with Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) shows 10 of the total 27 persons who died of swine flu were residents of the city. Remaining 17 persons were residents of other districts from Vidarbha and Madhya Pradesh (MP). They were diagnosed and also died in city hospitals.Similarly, 63 of total 149 persons found positive for swine flu were residents of the city and remaining 86 from other districts of Vidarbha and MP.The cases of swine flu started to increase from September, when there was a long dry spell after some rains. As of August 31, only two deaths and 10 positive cases had been recorded. Most of the cases were recorded in September and October. The cases started to reduce from middle of November as the winter set in.Between November 19 and December 31, only four deaths and 14 positive cases were registered. Last positive case was registered on December 27, who was a resident of Khamla.A NMC official told TOI cases are likely to reduce further in this month due to cold temperature prevailing in entire region for last 10 days.City had started to witness swine flu cases from 2010-11, when 17 deaths and 79 positive cases were recorded. The highest number of cases — 55 deaths and 325 positive cases — were registered in 2014-15. Second highest number of cases — 37 deaths and 328 positive cases — were registered in 2017-18.Earlier, NMC used to register cases as per financial year. From 2017-18, the state government has directed NMC to register cases in both — calender year as well as financial year. As most of the cases are recorded between July and December-end, NMC has been able to derive a comparison with cases in previous years and 2018.Shockingly, despite high number of cases registered in the city, NMC does not have any stock of H1N1 influenza virus vaccine since June 30. Similar situation is prevailing in district hospitals and public health centres in rural areas of all 11 districts of Vidarbha.The state government has not supplied the vaccine. This injectable vaccine is very important for pregnant, hypersensitive, HIV patients and paramedical staff for prevention of an epidemic.NMC and other centres have Tami Flu tablets to be distributed among suspected patients and persons who are or have been in contact with patients."

PMCH had all the other test kits, except for malaria.Medical experts say the blood once donated has to be used within 35 days. In case of platelets, it can be used only within five days of donation.Officials said the PMCH blood bank problem occurred after its store manager was transferred to IGIMS. He incidentally took the key of the cupboard where the purchase register was kept. Hence, no item could be purchased.“We got the key from the store manager on Wednesday morning and immediately placed the order. For the time being, we have also given the charge of the store to another person,” PMCH chief medical officer O P Sinha told TOI.PMCH superintendent Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said an emergency meeting was called in this regard with the chief medical officer and two deputy superintendents and the malaria kits were immediately purchased from the approved supplier. “We will also order 10,000 more such kits within ten days,” Dr Prasad said.Sinha said around 600 units of blood were lying unprocessed at the PMCH blood bank because of lack of malaria test kit. “Now, we will process 200 units of blood daily,” he said and added around 90 units of blood were required on daily basis on an average."
"Now, Sree Chitra institute has latest technology to screen blood donors",2019-01-04,Thiruvananthapuram,"News,City News,Thiruvananthapuram News","Thiruvananthapuram: The department of transfusion medicine of Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology has introduced fully automated individual donor nucleic acid amplification testing (ID-NAT) for screening of blood donors for HIV, HBV (hepatitis B virus) and HCV (hepatitis C virus) prior to each transfusion.This newly-developed facility will be inaugurated by K M Chandrasekhar, president of the institute, on Friday and services will begin the same day.ID-NAT system detects HIV, HBV and HCV infections in blood at a very early stage compared to conventional tests like ELISA. Early detection by ID-NAT can thus reduce the risk of transfusion through infected blood significantly. Risk of transfusion transmitted infections (TTIs) is higher in patients requiring regular blood transfusions for thalassemia, sickle cell anemia and cancer. One unit of blood can be given to three persons in components, and if the blood is contaminated it can risk three lives in one go.Countries like the US, Japan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa and most of the European counties have made nucleic acid amplification testing mandatory for blood screening. In India, there are almost 100 blood banks using ID-NAT routinely."

Modern witch-hunts terrorise New Guinea highlands,2019-01-04,TSAK VALLEY (PAPUA NEW GUINEA),"News,World News,Rest of World News","TSAK VALLEY (PAPUA NEW GUINEA): A spate of brutal witch-hunts has plunged parts of Papua New Guinea 's highlands into a state of terror, as fearful tribes blame dark forces for their rapidly changing world.In one particularly horrifying incident, an elderly woman writhes and pleads hysterically as she is mercilessly beaten, raped and tortured on a hut floor, before her naked body — bloodied and nearly lifeless — is dragged outside, where a village mob beats and burns her until movement ceases.Almost everyone joins in. No one bothers to obscure their face. No one tries to stop it.The crowd believe what they are doing is right: the only way to stop a non-human sorcerer who has killed their clansman and devoured his heart.The graphic scene was captured by cell phone video that was obtained by AFP. Dozens of similar videos have been gathered as evidence by the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary showing the brutal reality of modern-day witch-hunts.There have been at least 20 murders linked to sorcery accusations in this part of the highlands in the past few years, and dozens more violent attacks.In places like the remote Tsak Valley, attacks have spread ""like bushfire"", said Senior Inspector Epenes Nili, even resulting in an attack on the country's then chief justice.Belief in sorcery and witchcraft has long been common across Enga province and Papua New Guinea, but these lynchings are not some ancient rite or custom.""This is a new phenomenon,"" insisted Anton Lutz, a Lutheran missionary who has spent his life in Enga Province and has rescued accused sorcerers, some as young as six.Other researchers say widespread lynchings are new in Enga, and the extreme brutality and sexual nature of the attacks is unheard of.""We did have ancient beliefs about ghosts and ancient beliefs about stones that could talk and all kinds of interesting things,"" Lutz said.""But this practice of accusing a woman of causing a death and torturing her sadistically and sexually for hours until she dies, that is a new thing.""""It began about five years ago,"" he said. ""We had a serious rise last year. It just seemed like there was an attack happening every week, every fortnight.""According to Lutz, each spasm of violence seemed to begin with a death that locals found difficult to explain.Heart attacks, diabetes and HIV/AIDS are becoming more common, but are still not well understood. The death of an otherwise healthy person was more easily blamed on sorcery than cholesterol.Even a recent drunk driving crash that killed eight people prompted a violent witch-hunt, as people tried to explain why some passengers survived and others did not.The sheer number of people involved in the mob attacks ensures that news spreads quickly, as does fear, due to the widespread belief that witches don't act alone.The emergence of ""Glasman"" — opportunist ""diviners"" who travel the countryside detecting witches for money — also exponentially increased the rate of killings. So too did tribally ordained retribution.Like the old woman in the video, 55-year-old mother-of-two Rachel, was accused of ""sanguma"" — sorcery. Her story shows how quickly suspicion can turn into violence.Her life changed suddenly in April 2017, when she went with her family to pay her respects at a funeral service for a member of a neighbouring tribe.She was getting ready to leave, looking for her children, when she was grabbed by the dead man's son.Unbeknown to Rachel, another woman had been accused of involvement in his death and under torture named Rachel as part of a coven.Rachel pleaded innocence. But she was stripped and, like the murdered woman in the video, violated and burned with hot machetes, spades and rods for a full day by people she knew who were trying to make her ""return the heart"" of her ""victim"".""The pain was beyond endurance,"" she recalled, speaking to AFP as a crowd of locals — some curious, others appearing suspicious — gathered near her hut. ""I thought I would die.""With her mouth gagged, and the pain too much to bear, she managed only a silent prayer: ""'You gave me the job of caring for my children, but if I die, who will care for them?'""Only a dispute among the mob, estimated at around a thousand people, saved her life.Across Papua New Guinea the specifics of witch-hunts are bafflingly different.In Enga, the victims of violence are almost exclusively women. But on Bougainville island they are almost always men. In Port Moresby , where violence linked to sorcery accusations has also increased, men and women are targeted.Researcher Miranda Forsyth at the Australian National University , who has studied hundreds of such cases, sees grim patterns emerging.She describes a ""script"" of violent responses to suspected sorcerers that is spreading across Enga.Part of the phenomenon is people trying to deal with ""high levels of uncertainty due to dramatic economic, social and cultural changes"", Forsyth said.Authorities know the toxic brew will be difficult to remedy.In the meantime, fear has ""turned the whole place into a paranoid mess"", said Lutz.Almost two years after Rachel's attack, she can walk again and has returned to her village, although even among her own people, she still lives in fear.""The situation is still tense,"" she said in a near whisper.The burns she sustained in the attack had only partially been treated when a mob came to the clinic where she was recuperating, forcing her to flee. She still complains of skin being tight and painful around her torso.""Even though I still need surgery, I am afraid my attackers might kill me if I go. So I live with the pain.""""I hope that things will calm down so that I can go to the hospital, but for now, the way is closed."""

Islamabad seeks ex-envoy Hussain Haqqani’s extradition from US,2019-01-06,"Pakistan’s government has initiated a process of seeking extradition of its former ambassador to the US Hussain Haqqani on allegations of embezzlement following its failure to get him through Interpol . Haqqani, who served as ambassador from 2008 to 2011 in US, was removed from office for his alleged role in the “Memogate” issue.The controversy revolved around a memo seeking help from the Obama administration in the wake of the US raid that killed Osama bin Laden to avert a military takeover in Pakistan .

Transfusion of HIV blood: Panel seeks time till January 9 to give report,2019-01-06,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News","CHENNAI: After two lab technicians failed to turn up before the committee appointed by the health department to probe the case of pregnant women given HIV-infected blood , the panel has sought for an extension till January 9 to submit to its report On December 26, health secretary J Radhakrishnan issued a government order asking a six-member committee under the chairmanship of additional director of medical services Dr S Madhavi to inquire into the case and submit a report in a week. The panel, comprised of senior doctors including Madras Medical College professor of internal medicine Dr S Raghunandhan, Tirunelveli Medical College professor of blood transfusion Dr S A Manimala and Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University associate professor Dr Swathandran Hamsawardhini, began its probe on December 28The team, however, could not complete the inquiry on time as two lab technicians failed to depose before the committee. “It is not binding on them to appear before the committee. So, we cannot bring them by force. But we wanted to give them a chance to give their version,” a member of the committee said.Preliminary inquiries conducted by a team led by Virudhunagar joint director (health) Dr Manohar found that officials at the blood bank and HIV/AIDS counsellors had erred at least twice before they transfused the HIV-infected blood to the woman. In 2016, the donor had given blood at a camp in Sattur in Virudhunagar district. The government hospital there tested the sample positive for HIV but the counsellor at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre failed to inform the donor of his status. When he gave blood a second time in November, the blood was issued to a pregnant woman in Sivakasi . “The testing kit used by the PHC is reliable and is supplied by NACO for centres across India. So far, it does not look like a machine error. We want the technicians to tell us what went wrong,” said a senior doctor."

"Meerut doc cycles hundreds of km in UP, U’khand urging people to make ‘medical kundli’ before tying the knot",2019-01-07,Meerut,"News,City News,Meerut News","Meerut: Dr Anil Nausaran, a 49-year-old pathologist from Meerut, still remembers the day in July 2018 when he got to know that his 21-year-old patient was detected with HIV because she married a man with AIDS six months ago. “I was shocked. The girl had become pregnant. And when her anti-natal profile was checked, she was detected HIV positive. On further investigation, I found that she married a man who did not reveal the disease to her.”The doctor adds, “That’s when I thought that we match horoscopes, check families and investigate so many other things before fixing a marriage, but why do we fail to check if the person has any sexually transmitted disease like AIDS. That is when I thought I’ll urge people to make ‘medical kundlis’ before getting their children married.”Since July last year, Dr Nausaran has cycled from Meerut to Mussoorie, Bareilly and Haridwar with the message. He now aims to cycle from Kashmir to Kanyakumari by the end of this year. “I first tried to spread the message by conducting awareness drives in the city. I distributed posters and calendars with messages of how to prevent the spread of AIDS. The posters also have messages of making it compulsory to have medical kundlis and get them checked for their partners before tying the knot,” said the Meerut-based doctor who was born in Saharanpur’s Nagal village.His posters and calendars read, “Shaadi se pehle medical Kundli banwayein. Ladke-ladki ka HIV test karwayein.” (Make medical kundlis before getting married. Get the boy and girl HIV tested).Later, he got a cycle to spread the word around. He slowly increased his cycling distance from within the city, to places such as Khatauli, Muzaffarnagar, Haridwar, Dehradun and then Mussourie. He has also been to Moradabad and Bareilly to spread the message.When asked how he managed to cycle with the posters, he said, “My old friend Sandeep Rana helped me travel with ease. He always accompanies me in his car and keeps medical assistance handy.”Elaborating on the medical tests, he said, “Blood tests should be done to check for sexually transmitted diseases before fixing a match. Also, genotyping should be done to detect any abnormal gene.”While crisscrossing through Muzaffarnagar and other places, Dr Nausaran realised that people were not shy to talk about HIV. “Unlike what I had expected, people weren’t shy to discuss about AIDS. In fact, they were very welcoming and appreciated the message that I was spreading.”While sharing an experience, he said, “During one of my campaigns, I came across a father-son duo wherein the man had got infected with HIV from his wife, who was a divorcee. Their 10-year-old son too was an HIV positive. After going through my posters, not only they appreciated my cause but also regretted that if they knew about such diseases before, their lives would have been very different now.”Dr RC Gupta, principal of Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, who had attended one of his cycle rallies, said, “This is a great initiative and should be followed by everybody. It is a step towards a safer future.”"
Artist to take paintings on children in distress to 100 schools,2019-01-09,MADURAI,"News,City News,Madurai News","MADURAI: It was 1996 when artist CD Jain from Thiruvananthapuram was put up in a star hotel in Madurai. He found a 14-year-old girl selling flowers near the hotel. He sympathized with her for not going to school, not realizing that there was even worse news awaiting. “She was a call girl. I could not believe my ears and this haunted me for days,” he said. This provided the spark for him to come out with contemporary drawings and paintings on children in distress.Since then he has more than 550 paintings on children, apart from painting on other subjects. “I am now on a mission to take select paintings from my collection to 100 schools in India and abroad. My paintings are based on the interactions I had with 400 children in distress in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Some were about sexual abuse, exposed to bonded labour and other forms of cruelty that has affected them for life,” he said.He wanted to start it in Madurai as he got the spark here. Among dozens of interactions with children, he recalls one with a 16-year-old HIV affected girl in Bengaluru and a 14-year-old ragpicker boy in Madurai. “The girl was just 14 years when her mother sold her to a pimp. The man took her to Mumbai where she was forced to work as a sex worker. She later tested positive for HIV and sent back home,” he said. But hiding her ailment her mother once again tried to sell her to another broker. The girl however overheard the conversation and fled. This was when the artist met her through an NGO.The other person was a boy engaged in rag picking. “I interacted with him and wanted to make a sketch of him, with his permission,” Jain recalled.“The boy was so particular that even his sketch should not have any scribbling. This is the way every child would feel when they are subjected to physical and sexual abuse, labour and other hardships,” said the artist. He has painted on topics such as child labour, bonded labour, child abuse, destitute child, mother and child, benign forest, cheerful children and missing children.In the travelling expo, he wants children to understand the plight of their underprivileged counterparts and to develop empathy for them. He said the expo will be free in government schools, while private schools will have to get a few greetings he has made with pictures of his paintings."

Tamil Nadu violates its own policy on blood safety,2018-12-28,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Civic Issues","CHENNAI: Almost eleven months after the Tamil Nadu government rolled out a policy to ensure safety and availability of blood, its own hospitals are flouting the norms.The state blood transfusion council announced that asking relatives of patients to donate blood for elective procedures or deliveries will be a punishable offence and lead to temporary closure of the hospital and blood bank . Yet, across the state most public hospitals have been asking relatives of pregnant women and other patients to donate blood as a replacement.This is how on November 30, a 19-year-old person infected with HIV , though he did not know it at that point, ended up donating blood; his relative, a pregnant woman, required a blood transfusion and he donated to replace it. The infected blood was issued to another hospital and given to another woman, who has now tested positive for HIV.“When the state announced the policy it said that hospitals like all other service providers should ensure patients and their relatives are not harassed,” said Doctors Association for Social Equality general secretary Dr G R Ravindranath. “It had asked blood banks to look for safer methods such as periodic blood donation camps. For its own hospitals and primary health centres it had charted out a plan to organise blood donation camps. But that never happened. District collectors and blood safety officers should have ensured they are stocked. Most banks don’t even offer blood components,” he said.Repeated voluntary blood donation is promoted because risks are lower. The state did not hold massive awareness programmes to encourage repeated voluntary blood donation. Statistics show less than three out of ten donors in the state volunteer to donate repeatedly.The incident has come as a blow to the state health department, which has been ranked second in health by Niti Ayog in the Sustainable Development Goals India baseline report, 2018, with a maternal mortality ratio of 66 compared to the national average of 130. It has one of highest number of government doctors, nurses and midwives per 100,000 population in the country. “Yet, it is sad that the state which boasts of being a leader in public health care doesn’t have a safe blood policy. When 60% of women deliver at GHs, shouldn’t the state stock adequate blood. Why should they rely on replacement blood at all? In this case it was not even a rare blood group. Most labs don’t even have standard testing equipment or trained staff,” said HIV/AIDS activist K Radhakrishnan.The average consumption of blood in upgraded PHC and community health centres is 60 units a year and taluk hospitals require about 200 units. Most hospitals don’t stock adequate blood because the co-ordination between the blood bank officer and the doctors is very poor."
"AIDS control society in slumber, no outreach drive for years: NGOs",2018-12-28,MADURAI,"News,City News,Madurai News","MADURAI: NGOs involved in HIV/AIDS prevention in co-ordination with Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (Tansacs) say that the society is in sleep mode at present with payment to workers being delayed inordinately and no outreach or sensitization or awareness programme conducted for a long time, which are crucial for the prevention of the disease.On Wednesday, health secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan had told reporters that the boy had tested positive for HIV and hepatitis when his blood was screened after a donation and that he had not come back for counselling after having been contacted by the counsellors. However, the uncle of the donor who was standing outside the ward where the teenager was admitted to after attempting suicide, claimed that neither the donor nor his family was aware of his HIV positive status. It had come as a shock to them when he tested positive recently. ``It was my nephew who rushed to the Sivakasi hospital on coming to know he was positive and informed them that he had donated blood. So, how would he have known it earlier?’’ he said.Counsellors at the integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) usually take the help of outreach workers of NGOs who work with Tansacs to locate a person who is suspected to be infected. A counsellor at one of the ICTCs in Madurai on condition of anonymity said that they had not attended a refresher training programme for a long time now. Co-convener of Tansacs NGO/Community based organisations, (CBO) Forum, Berlin Jose, said that there were 72 NGOs across the state working with Tansacs for AIDS prevention and fund allocations had been a major problem for them in the past four years. Outreach workers received their five months’ pay dues on Thursday only.It was the outreach worker who went to the field and located people whose blood tested positive and brought them for counselling and conducted sensitization programme. But they were being paid a meagre Rs 7,500 per month for the past 15 years, with a monthly travel allowance of Rs 750 which had not been paid for months. Many counsellors appointed on contract basis at the ICTCs were former field workers who were being paid Rs 20,000 a month.It has been a long time since training programmes were conducted for personnel at the ICTC as well as ART centres, Jose said. He added that without proper enumeration, the government had been claiming that incidence and prevalence of HIV/AIDS had come down in the districts, which was far from the truth. ``We work with the community and when we take the targeted segment to the ICTC, they either say they have no time or do not have testing kits and send us back,’’ he said. Though it is specified that these counsellors should work from 8 AM to 5 PM, they often left the centres by 1 PM and there was no monitoring mechanism for that too, he said.Project director of PACHE trust, R Manoharan, who has been working with the target groups since 1997, says that activities of Tansacs had declined drastically. The behavioural sentinel surveillance survey, mandatory for obtaining high-quality data about a disease when it cannot be obtained through the passive system, had not been done in a long time. “Hence, the present statistics shown by the government on HIV/AIDS cannot be accurate’’, he said. The disease was also on the rise among the hidden community, which includes people from upper economic strata."

The report should be filed by January 3.The NHRC noted that families involved were trying to cope with the trauma even as more details emerged of criminal negligence on the part of public health care personnel.The commission has issued a notice to the chief secretary calling for a detailed report in the matter including action taken against the guilty and relief/counselling provided to the victims, within four weeks.“It has been observed that the contents of the media reports, if true, amount to violation of human rights of the victims and medical negligence. As reported, had proper action been taken by the authorities when the donor was first recognized as a case of HIV+, the mishap could have been avoided. Now both, the donor and the recipient woman are going through trauma,” said a press release from NHRC.A nationwide move is required to be taken to examine the procedures so that Right to Life of the innocent people is not violated, the NHRC said."
‘Donor ignoring ICTC summons being probed’,2018-12-28,MADURAI,,"MADURAI: The claim of the ICTC counsellor that the teenage donor, who was responsible infecting for the pregnant woman from Sattur with the HIV virus, had tested positive for the virus in 2016 and that he had not answered the summons, was under investigation, said the project director of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Organisation (Tansacs) Dr K Senthil Raj.Dr Raj visited the infected woman and the donor at the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai on Thursday after visiting Virudhunagar and said that steps had been taken to ensure that the woman got the best possible treatment, and priority was to ensure that her unborn infant was not affected. On the donor’s claim that he had not got any call from the counsellor at the Sivakasi government hospital on his HIV positive status after he donated blood in 2016, he said that it was under investigation.All employees of the integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) were qualified in their respective fields and were appointed on contract basis which was renewed annually, with no recruitments being made in recent times, he said. The functioning of the centres was foolproof and that was why the longevity of the infected persons had gone up from 30 to 40 years when they were under regular medication. He urged mediapersons to refrain from interacting with the donor, who had claimed that he had attempted to commit suicide because the media was cornering him. Members of the Positive Network people were also interacting with him and his condition had stabilised, he said.Earlier, speaking at Virudhunagar, he said that 464 units of blood from the four blood banks in Virudhunagar district had been secured and re-examined and those from private banks would also be subjected to the same."

"Now, death penalty for sex assault on minors",2018-12-29,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: In what is seen as a stepped up effort to crack down on child abuse, the Union Cabinet on Friday approved a set of changes in the law that will make aggravated penetrative sexual assaults during communal and sectarian violence or in the midst or aftermath of a natural calamity punishable with minimum of 20 years extending upto life imprisonment or even death.The amendments to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, set out a minimum 20 years imprisonment for “aggravated penetrative sexual assault” which includes assault on a child below 12 years. The significance in the changes adopted by the Cabinet lies in list of crime situations that fall in this category is that it will, in a first, include a person who takes advantage of a child in a situation of natural calamity to commit an sexual assault or causes the death of the victim.Going by the existing list under this provision, the enhanced punishment will apply to crimes committed on a child in communal and sectarian violence, an assault that leaves a child physically incapacitated, mentally ill, affected by HIV , disabled or pregnant. And the punishment may extend to life and even death penalty.The amendments, piloted by the WCD ministry, will now need to go to Parliament to become law.Aggravated penetrative sexual assaults as of now invite a punishment of not less than 10 years that may extend to life along with fine. The enhanced punishment will also apply to any police officer who commits penetrative sexual assault on a child in police station premises, in the course of his duty or otherwise. As per the law members of the armed forces, security forces, public servants and management and staff of jails, remand homes and protection homes guilty of such crimes will be up for the enhanced punishment.Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the amendments are required to “deter the rising trend of child sex abuse in the country”.On why natural calamity situations have been included, the government has argued that children are often the worst affected by disasters. It is pointed that in the three months following the earthquake in Nepal in 2015, 513 children and women at the risk of being trafficked were intercepted. There were also reports of rape of young girls including a Kedarnath deluge survivor.To check sexual exploitation, administration of hormones to a child to induce sexual maturity to enable sexual activity has been included in the separate “aggravated sexual assault category” which will invite a jail term upto three years and fine. Possession and circulation of pornographic material involving a child for commericial purpose will invite not less than three years in jail that may extend to five and can go up to seven years if convicted the second time.In the backdrop of a spate of cases of sexual abuse emanating from children homes the aggravated sexual assault cateogry is being amended. The current provision calls for punishment for whoever on the management or on the staff of a jail, remand home commits sexual assault on a child. This will now be amended to include “or causes sexual assault by giving or receiving any payment or benefits to the child or to any other person exercising control over the child”The amendments approved by the Cabinet will enable gender neutral implemention of the punishment provisions in line with the criminal law amendment Act, 2013, that applies to rape crimes with upto death for cases involving a girl child below 12 years. The changes were a fallout of a public outcry for stricter action after the Kathua and Unnao rape cases where the victims were minors.The government’s justification for a change in provision is that media reports and complaints have revealed that children are being subjected to various kinds of sexual abuse and exploitation by making payments to children themselves, parents or guardians, or other people in whose custody the child is kept.In a recent judgement in the matter of Apna Ghar , a shelter home in Haryana , the CBI judge found the woman, who ran the shelter home, her relatives and staff, guilty of such crimes."

"PMK keeps alliance options open, DMK not too interested",2018-12-31,COIMBATORE,"News,City News,Puducherry News","COIMBATORE: With the Lok Sabha elections round-the-corner, the PMK, known to swing between the AIADMK and DMK-led alliances in the past, is carefully weighing its options for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. On Sunday, at the conclusion of his party’s twoday general body meeting in Coimbatore, PMK youth wing president and de-facto chief Anbumani Ramadoss told reporters, “We will form an alliance with like-minded parties for the Lok Sabha elections"". The PMK’s general body authorised his father and PMK founder S Ramadoss to decide on matters pertaining to electoral alliances.Sources say that DMK is far from keen on including PMK in its grand Congress-inclusive alliance in Tamil Nadu given that the party was likely to drive a hard bargain for seats. But, the AIADMK may have already sent out feelers to embrace the vanniyar party into its fold, which, in all likelihood, would include Narendra Modi’s BJP as well. “While the PMK would prefer to team up with the DMK-Congress alliance, it is keeping its options open,” said a senior party leader, seeking anonymity. “But, we will not settle for anything less than satisfactory,” the leader added. The PMK, he said, was all set to drive a hard bargain and hoped for the deal it got in 2004 as part of the UPA – five seats in TN besides the lone Puducherry seat. But, with DMK having to accommodate many friendly parties, including the Congress, MDMK, VCK, CPI and CPM, that could prove a tough bargain for the PMK, eventually forcing it towards an AIADMK-led alliance.Given the compulsions, a cautious PMK refrained from attacking both AIADMK and DMK during its meeting. But for its demand for sacking health minister C Vijaya Bhaskar over the controversy of a pregnant woman being infected by blood donated by a HIV positve donor and his subsequent suicide, the PMK was silent on both parties. One resolution passed at the meeting, however, accused the BJP of being miserly in releasing cyclone relief funds for Tamil Nadu. In fact, the PMK was careful not to attack the Congress, DMK or AIADMK in any of its resolutions.When questioned about this by reporters, Anbumani said under the Congress-led UPA regime, Sri Lankan Tamil and fishermen issues were not redressed. “We condemned the Congress too. As for alliances, our party founder will decide,” said Anbumani.Another resolution took credit for the various welfare schemes introduced in Tamil Nadu during the 2004-09 UPA regime when Anbumani Ramadoss was health and family welfare minister and R Velu was Union minister of state for railways. “The PMK should have more representatives in the Lok Sabha,” said Anbumani, the PMK’s lone MP."

China's Disappeared: A look at who went missing in 2018,2018-12-31,BEIJING,"News,World News,China News","BEIJING: It's not uncommon for individuals who speak out against the government to disappear in China, but the scope of the ""disappeared'' has expanded since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2013.Not only dissidents and activists, but also high-level officials, Marxists, foreigners and even a movie star — people who never publicly opposed the ruling Communist Party — have been whisked away by police to unknown destinations.The widening dragnet throws into stark relief the lengths to which Xi's administration is willing to go to maintain its control and authority.A look at some of the people who went missing in 2018 at the hands of the Chinese state:China threatened ``grave consequences'' if Canada did not release high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou, shortly after the Huawei chief financial officer was detained in Vancouver in December for possible extradition to the U.S.The apparent consequences materialized within days, when two Canadian men went missing in China. Both turned up in the hands of state security on suspicion of endangering national security, a nebulous category of crimes that has been levied against foreigners in recent years.Former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig was taken by authorities from a Beijing street late in the evening, a person familiar with his case said. He is allowed one consular visit a month and has not been granted access to a lawyer, as is standard for state security cases.Also detained is Michael Spavor, who organizes tours to North Korea from the border city of Dandong. China has not said whether their detentions are related to Meng's, but a similar scenario unfolded in the past.A Canadian couple was detained in 2014 on national security grounds shortly after Canada arrested Su Bin, a Chinese man wanted for industrial espionage in the U.S.Like Spavor, Kevin and Julia Garratt lived in Dandong, where they ran a popular coffee shop for nearly a decade. They also worked with a Christian charity that provided food to North Korean refugees.While Julia Garratt was released on bail, her husband was held for more than two years before he was deported in September 2016 _ about two months after Su pleaded guilty in the US. Fan Bingbing was living the dream. Since a breakthrough role at the age of 17, Fan has headlined dozens of movies and TV series, and parlayed her success into modeling, fashion design and other ventures that have made her one of the highest-paid celebrities in the world.All this made her a potent icon of China's economic success, until authorities reminded Fan — and her legion of admirers — that even she was not untouchable.For about four months, Fan vanished from public view. Her Weibo social media account, which has more than 63 million followers, fell silent. Her management office in Beijing was vacated. Her birthday on Sept. 16 came and went with only a handful of greetings from entertainment notables.When she finally resurfaced, it was to apologize.""I sincerely apologize to society, to the friends who love and care for me, to the people, and to the country's tax bureau,'' Fan said in a letter posted on Weibo on Oct. 3.She admitted to tax evasion. State news agency Xinhua reported that Fan and the companies she represents had been ordered to pay taxes and penalties totaling 900 million yuan ($130 million).""Without the party and the country's great policies, without the people's loving care, there would be no Fan Bingbing,'' she wrote, a cautionary tale for other Chinese celebrities.Xinhua concurred in a commentary on her case: ""Everyone is equal before the law, there are no 'superstars' or `big shots.' No one can despise the law and hope to be lucky.""Unlike most swallowed up by China's opaque security apparatus, Meng Hongwei knew exactly what to expect.Meng, no relation to the Huawei executive, is a vice minister of public security who was also head of Interpol, the France-based organization that facilitates police cooperation across borders.When he was appointed to the top post, human rights groups expressed concern that China would use Interpol as a tool to rein in political enemies around the world.Instead, he was captured by the same security forces he represented.In September, Meng became the latest high-ranking official caught in Xi's banner anti-corruption campaign. The initiative is a major reason for the Chinese leader's broad popularity, but he has been accused of using it to eliminate political rivals.Xi pledged to confront both high-level ``tigers'' and low-level ``flies'' in his crackdown on graft _ a promise he has fulfilled by ensnaring prominent officials.Meng was missing for weeks, before Chinese authorities said he was being investigated for taking bribes and other crimes. A Chinese delegation delivered a resignation letter from Meng to Interpol headquarters.His wife Grace Meng told the AP that she does not believe the charges against her husband. The last message he sent her was an emoji of a knife.Lu Guang made his mark photographing the everyday lives of HIV patients in central China. They were poor villagers who had contracted the virus after selling their own blood to eke out a living _ at a going rate of $7 a pint, they told Lu.A former factory worker, Lu traversed China's vast reaches to capture reality at its margins. He explored environmental degradation, industrial pollution and other gritty topics generally avoided by Chinese journalists, who risk punishment if they pursue stories considered to be sensitive or overly critical.His work won him major accolades such as the World Press Photo prize, but his prominence likely also put him on the government's radar.This November, Lu was travelling through Xinjiang, the far west region that has deployed a vast security network in the name of fighting terrorism. He was participating in an exchange with other photographers, after which he was to meet a friend in nearby Sichuan province. He never showed up.More than a month after he disappeared, his family was notified that he had been arrested in Xinjiang, according to his wife Xu Xiaoli. She declined to elaborate on the nature of the charges.In the past, the political activists jailed in China were primarily those who fought for democracy and an end to one-party rule. They posed a direct ideological threat to the Communist Party.This year, the party locked in on a surprising new target: young Marxists.About 50 students and recent graduates of the country's most prestigious universities convened in August in Shenzhen, an electronics manufacturing hub, to rally for factory workers attempting to form a union.Among them was Yue Xin, a 20-something fresh out of Peking University. Earlier this year, she made headlines by calling for the elite school to release the results of its investigation into a decades-old rape case.This time, she was one of the most vocal leaders of the labor rights group, appearing in photographs with her fist up in a Marxist salute and wearing a T-shirt that said ""Unity is strength"" — the name of a patriotic Chinese communist song.Yue, a passionate student of Marx and Mao Zedong, espoused the same values as the party. She wrote an open letter to Xi and the party's central leadership saying all the students wanted was justice for Jasic Technology laborers.Her letter quoted Xi's own remarks: ""We must adhere to the guiding position of Marxism.'' Yue called Marx ``our mentor'' and likened the ideas of him and Mao to spiritual sustenance.Nonetheless, she ended up among those rounded up in a raid on the apartment the activists were staying at in Shenzhen. While most have been released, Yue remains unaccounted for. She has been missing for four months."
Another woman says she got HIV from donor blood,2018-12-29,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Crime","CHENNAI: Two days after reports about HIV-infected blood being transfused into a pregnant woman, a Chennai-based woman said she too has acquired the viral infection after undergoing treatment at the government-run Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital (KMCH).The woman, who gave birth to a boy on September 15, told reporters that she tested positive after she was administered two units of blood at the hospital in April. Hospital dean Dr Vasanthamani P rejected the claim.As per medical records, the woman visited a primary health centre in Mangadu on March 6 when doctors confirmed her pregnancy. In April, doctors referred her to KMCH for blood transfusion after they found her haemoglobin level was low. The report of a blood test she did at a private hospital on February 12 shows HIV negative.At KMCH she was given two units of blood on April 5 and April 6, and she got discharged 10 days later. She was referred back to the hospital in August after scans showed the fetus was in “breech position” (legs down). That’s when the hospital ordered the HIV test. “Usually we assign a number along with every HIV test done. Her records did not have the number. So we repeated the test and she tested positive. We started her on medication and help her deliver a healthy baby in September,” said hospital dean Dr Vasanthamani P.The woman said she was forced to remain silent as she feared that she would be ostracized by her family and friends. But she petitioned health minister C Vijaya Baskar, health secretary J Radhakrishnan and other senior administrators. “I did not receive any call from the government. When I read about how another pregnant woman acquired the infection, I decided to talk about my condition,” she said. “My husband has no infection. This hospital is the only possible source of infection,” she said.Director of medical education Dr A Edwin Joe said the government ordered for an inquiry in December. “Today, the inquires revealed said the blood provided by the hospital was tested safe,” he said.The two units of blood (1962 and 2129) administered to the woman were labelled safe after they were screened on high-end equipment. While one of the blood samples were sourced from a college student, the other was a regular voluntary blood donor. “We have a machine printed copy that says the samples were safe,” said Dr Vasanthamani. “It is difficult for us to point out the infection source now,” she said.Health activists and NGOs say the state health department should do a more detailed inquiry to clear its name. “It is important for the hospitals to recall the donors for a HIV test. If they test negative, it is evident that the disease was not transfused through blood. What if the test was false negative because they were in their window period,” said Karunanidhi, who works for a positive network NGO.Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society project director K Senthil Raj said the state has not dropped its guard on blood screening. “We have a robost screening programme. At least 60% of deliveries happen in GH. There is no need for women to panic,” he said."
Madras HC directs to videograph HIV+ve donor’s autopsy,2019-01-01,MADURAI,"News,City News,Madurai News","MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday directed that the postmortem of the 19-year-old HIV positive donor whose blood was transfused to an anaemic woman be conducted at the Madurai Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in the presence of two assistant professors from medical colleges of neighbouring districts. The bench also directed the dean to ensure that the autopsy was videographed from various angles.Justice B Pugalendhi, who took up the case at a special sitting, issued the directions after the deceased boy’s mother moved the court on Monday raising doubts over his death. The teenager had attempted suicide last Wednesday by consuming rat poison and was undergoing treatment at GRH, where he died on Sunday. The boy, who was working as a labourer at a fireworks unit in Sivakasi , had first donated blood at the blood bank on November 30 without realizing that he was HIV-infected. This blood was transfused to the 23-year-old pregnant woman on December 3 and she also got infected.In the petition, the woman stated that her son discontinued school in Class IX and went to work in Sivakasi in 2016 as a daily wage labourer. She said her son had to undergo a blood test for his job requirement abroad and the lab results showed him to be HIV positive after which he checked with the Sivakasi government hospital and found that his blood was transfused to a pregnant woman. “In fact my son himself alerted the hospital officials about his infection after the private lab found him to be infected,” the petitioner stated.After it was ascertained that a pregnant woman was infected with HIV, pictures of my son were showed on some television channels leading to his identification. Upset over this and lack of counselling, he attempted suicide on December 26. The petitioner stated that after three days of treatment at Madurai GRH, her son was back to normal. However, on December 30, around 5 am, three doctors and a nurse arrived after he complained of pain in his private parts. Three hours later, her son was declared dead.Stating that even the district collector was not informed of the boy’s death until evening, the family raised suspicions over the treatment offered in the last hour leading to his death. When the petition came up for hearing, Justice B Pugalendhi granted the relief sought by the family. The court directed that the autopsy be conducted as per rules laid down and directed two assistant professors from either Sivaganga, Tirunelveli or Theni medical colleges to assist in the autopsy. The court also made it clear that the relief granted in this case could not be a precedent in cases of suspicious death and it was granted considering the special circumstances."

"Health officials hold surprise check at three blood banks in Trichy, find no flaws",2018-12-30,TRICHY,"News,City News,Trichy News","TRICHY: A team of officials from the district health department conducted surprise inspections at three blood banks in Trichy on Friday. The officials said that during the inspections, they found no flaws in the way the blood banks were operating and that the records didn’t have any discrepancies too.In the past one year, around 13 samples of donated blood were tested positive for diseases like syphilis hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS and all those were immediately discarded by the respective blood banks.TOI had reported that in the aftermath of the incident, where the blood of an HIV-positive youth was transfused into a pregnant woman at a government hospital in Sattur, there would be widespread inspections at blood banks in Trichy district.The blood banks that were inspected on Friday included two from government hospitals and one private blood bank (Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH), Government Headquarters Hospital in Manapparai and Friends Blood Bank).Joint director of health services Dr S Samsath Begum, who led the inspection, told TOI that the functioning of all the three blood banks was as prescribed and that they had also maintained accurate records. “We checked their functioning over the course of the past one year,” she added.It has been said that among the donated bloods over the past one year, two samples were detected positive for HIV , 10 for hepatitis B and a case of syphilis. “The blood samples had been promptly discarded by the officials. The donors, whose blood samples were detected positive for the diseases, were also given treatments,” Dr Begum said.According to the sources, other 10 blood banks would also be inspected over the course of the next few days. “The blood bank officials have also been instructed to send their monthly report to the district health department, and Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society,” the source said.Meanwhile, citing how few donors came to know that they were infected with certain diseases through blood test, Trichy programme manager of District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), Dr S Martin Manivannan said that blood donation offers the general public a chance to know about their general health."
Lack of malaria test kits hits PMCH blood bank,2019-01-02,PATNA,"News,City News,Patna News,Schools & Colleges","PATNA: Lack of malaria test kits may result in blood crisis at 24X7 blood bank at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH).According to sources, the blood bank has been running short of malaria test kits since December 17. As a result, processing of blood has stopped at the blood bank. One piece of malaria test kit costs between Rs 20 and Rs 25.Medical experts said once a person donates blood, it undergoes five mandatory tests – malaria, HIV, hepatitis-B and C and VDRL. Even ELISA test is mandatory before the blood is infused to another person.City-based social activist Mukesh Hissariya, who organises blood donation camps, said, “Once blood is donated, it can be kept for 35 days. However, platelets can be used only within five days of donation. Hence, if the donated blood is not processed at the PMCH soon, they will be of no use.”PMCH sources said though blood is available at the blood bank, those needing platelets are being returned due to lack of malaria test kits. On an average, about four people require platelet at the health facility.Sources said around 800 units of unprocessed blood are presently kept in the blood bank at PMCH.The blood bank also lacks required manpower. Of the eight sanctioned posts for doctors, only three are filled. All six posts of nurses are vacant. Besides, there are only 10 laboratory technicians against the sanctioned strength of 18.PMCH superintendent Dr Raniv Ranjan Prasad said the malaria test kits were in the hospital, but could not be used as the clerk in charge of store had been transferred to Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS).“The keys of the storeroom are with the clerk. I will hold a meeting to discuss the issue on Wednesday,” Dr Prasad added.Lack of blood or platelets is not new for this premier government hospital of the state. The hospital was running short of platelets even in October last year when there was a dengue outbreak in the city."

HIV positive woman lodges complaint against KMCH,2018-12-30,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Crime","CHENNAI: A woman from Mangadu on Saturday lodged a complaint at the city police commissionerate against the staff of Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital staff for allegedly transfusing HIV-infected blood to her.On Friday, the woman met media persons and claimed that she learnt she was pregnant in December 2017. She was initially getting treatment at a primary health centre in Mangadu and subsequently, got blood tests, including that for HIV, done at a private hospital and the results showed that she was HIV negative. Her haemoglobin count, however, was found to be low and she was referred by the PHC to undergo blood transfusion at KMCH , she said. The woman underwent treatment at the hospital for around ten days and was discharged once haemoglobin levels improved.A few months later, she went for check up at KMCH and was found to be HIV positive, she said. The woman has alleged that she got the HIV infection after undergoing blood transfusion at KMCH and has accused the hospital’s negligence for her plight.The woman and her husband are vegetable vendors. The couple levelled allegations against the staff at the KMCH. “We are sure that we contracted the virus from the hospital, since we have results from an earlier test that show my wife didn’t have the infection,” the woman’s husband said.When we questioned KMCH staff after she tested positive post transfusion, they told there was not much that could be done now since she has contracted the infection. They argued that they were not responsible for her condition. Some of the staff members even told us that we won’t be able to fight the case in court since we did not have the monetary backing to do so,” he added.The woman who gave birth to a boy on September 15, said she was administered two units of blood at KMCH in April. The KMCH authorities said there seemed to have been some irregularities with the initial HIV screening done at private labs. They refused to speculate how the woman may have contracted the virus, but insisted that it did not happen at KMCH. Director of medical education Dr A Edwin Joe on Friday said the blood samples administered to the woman tested safe."
Walkouts may be the norm as DMK to keep Tamil Nadu government on its toes,2018-12-30,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Politics","CHENNAI: Caught between a slippery government which has managed to wriggle out of many a crisis and a bulldozer — T T V Dhinakaran — who has threatened to make the DMK bite the dust in its own bastion, Tiruvarur, represented till recently by the Dravidian patriarch M Karunanidhi , the principal opposition party is working overtime to devise a strategy, both within the assembly when it meets on January 2 and outside, where it has lined up a series of grama sabha meetings.DMK president M K Stalin has convened the DMK legislature party meeting at 5pm on January 2, the day governor is slated to address the assembly, to finalise the strategy the party MLAs should adopt in the forthcoming session. Going by the party’s plan so far, Stalin, after reading out a statement in the assembly, will lead a walk out march of the party MLAs, without sitting through the governor’s address.How far a belligerent Edappadi K Palaniswami government, which is now numerically dominant in the House, would give room for the DMK to manoeuvre within the assembly remains to be seen. As usual, the DMK may end up registering its protest before mediapersons outside the assembly hall. A statement from party whip R Sakkarapani on Saturday has asked all MLAs to attend the legislature party meeting.“We will not leave the government off the hook on any issue which is affecting public. Delta districts have not returned to normalcy even one month after Cyclone Gaja struck. We will seek explanation from the government on the measures taken so far,” said a senior party leader.The DMK is determined to corner the government on Sterlite issue too. The government purposefully weakened its case against the copper smelter plant by not following procedures in closing the plant, said a DMK leader. “We kept asking for a policy decision to shut polluting factories. But the government kept dodging saying everything had been done to shut Sterlite. The National Green Tribunal order to reopen Sterlite justifies our stand that the government was only facilitating the plant,” said the leader.Meanwhile, in a letter to party functionaries and cadres, Stalin, referring to a pregnant woman contracting HIV after blood transfusion in a government hospital in Virudhunagar district , said the party would corner the government for its inefficient handling of medical treatment in government hospitals.He has asked partymen to hold grama sabha meetings in all 12,617 village panchayats and send reports regularly to the party headquarters.“The fascist and sadist Central government has punished Tamil Nadu on a lot of issues, starting from making Neet compulsory to denying its rightful claim over its water sources (read Mekadathu and Mullaperiyar). It is time we uprooted both the governments,” said Stalin.Deviating from its oft-followed path of holding public meetings to reach out to the masses, he said it has now decided to carry out door-to-door campaigns to educate the TN people about the DMK’s contribution and also listen to their grievances.The grama sabha meetings have been rescheduled from January 8 to February 17. On account of Pongal celebrations, there would be a break from January 13 to 18, he said."

"Gujju family reunion, in ‘auto’ mode",2019-01-11,AHMEDABAD,"News,City News,Ahmedabad News","AHMEDABAD: On Thursday, two humble autorickshaws in the parking lot of a tony hotel on SG Road turned many heads as they stood beside more swanky automobiles. “Our two autos, named Hakuna and Matata, turned many heads along the road. Many people asked for rides and some even accompanied us,” recounts Minesh Patel, a senior executive with Deloitte in London.Minesh, along with his cousins Amish, Mehul, Sachin, Harsh and Parag, all cousins and part of a Patel family spread over three continents — Asia, Africa and Europe — took the road less-travelled as part of a national event organized by a private company, where participants travel to various destinations in humble autorickshaws. The group, consisting of English, Kenyan and Indian nationals, arrived in Ahmedabad on Wednesday morning.“We all are from very diverse backgrounds, from optometry to banking and IT to management, but what binds us is the need for adventure. We are from Gujarati families living abroad for one or more generations and what best way to see India than travelling by auto?” asks Amish, who owns a nursing home in Kenya.The group started off from Bengaluru on December 29 and expect to travel 2,000km to reach to Jaisalmer by next week like many of the other participants. “We had never driven on Indian roads, let alone an auto, it needs cooling every 100 hours with oil and it’s open. But it’s also the closest you can get to the Indian experience,” says Minesh.But this is not just a family reunion, the group is raising money for Just Imagine, an organization working with HIV+ orphan children in India and elsewhere. “We have so far raised about £17,000 (about Rs 15 lakh) which exceeded our expectations. For many of us, it was our first visit to India and we are completely blown away by the hospitality and warmth at every location,” says Amish."

Odisha govt to provide Rs 20k to under-privileged students for higher studies,2019-01-12,BHUBANESWAR,"News,Education","BHUBANESWAR: Odisha government Friday decided to provide financial assistance to the children of under privileged families to pursue higher education, officials said.Under the new Financial Assistance Scheme, students of under privileged class will be provided Rs 20,000 annually for pursuing both graduate and post-graduate courses.In order to avail the new scheme, the beneficiary student should belong to HIV/AIDS affected family, parents suffering non-curable diseases, landless or homeless family, child of a single mother, women headed family in case of non-earning spouse.A decision in this regard was made at a meeting presided over by Higher Education Secretary B P Sethi here.Though the Department of Higher Education has implemented various schemes to make higher education inclusive and to increase the gross enrolment ratio , the government decided to start a new one for under students of privileged families.There are programmes like E-Medhabruti, Kalinga Sikhya Sathi Yojana and Green Passage to provide free education to orphan students pursuing Plus II to post-graduate education.The new assistance scheme will be limited to the duration of the course and will be given each year till completion of the course, Sethi said adding that the department has listed eligibility criteria for applying under the scheme.The student should have enrolled for under-graduate and post-graduate courses on regular mode from recognized colleges, institutions, universities in the state.And income from all sources of the family to which student belongs, should not be more than Rs 1 lakh per annum, he said adding that the financial assistance will be given through bank accounts."
Putting the fun in funerals,2019-01-13,"There are many things we want to talk about with family and friends; mortality isn’t one of them. But from death workshops to death cafes, there are plenty of signs that this is changingLying in a mass burial pit, it’s hard to not think to yourself",News,"There are many things we want to talk about with family and friends; mortality isn’t one of them. But from death workshops to death cafes, there are plenty of signs that this is changingLying in a mass burial pit, it’s hard to not think to yourself: how in the world did I get here? For the 12 participants who undertook this mock exercise at a Delhi workshop recently, the answer was not really morbid. They were there because they wanted to experience the past, present and future of death.It’s that five-letter word we usually don’t like to talk about, perhaps because we don’t really believe in our mortality. But that might be changing, with the death-positive movement catching on with those who seek to confront and celebrate the inevitable rather than fear it.Art historian Shaleen Wadhwana, who conducted the unusual workshop, says the exercise was meant to establish death as a “truth across time” and to make people see the “process of death with its own history when religion and society, as they know it, didn’t exist”. Apart from lying for five minutes in a recreated mass burial pit, participants made prehistoric paintings that summed up their lives; learnt about various sustainable forms of burial in vogue currently, and discussed how our digital footprint lives on after we die. The most powerful feedback Wadhwana got was from a little girl who had lost her mother. “She told me that the only thing weird about death is that we don’t talk about it,” says Wadhwana, who conducted the immersive workshop in collaboration with Bedlam, a creative community.Morbid as it may sound, death has also become the subject of dinner table conversations across the world. Death over Dinner, a global initiative, was brought to India last January by RoundGlass, a health and wellness firm. Helmed by multidisciplinary innovation researcher Krittika Sharma, the dinners have taken place in homes, restaurants, and most recently, at an art gallery in Vadodara. The attendees include strangers of all ages and occupations, but also often friends and family members of the host. Sharma says, “The conversations cover all aspects of death—emotional, spiritual, practical, philosophical and medical. Each dinner is unique due to the background of the guests. There is also a lot of laughter.”“Hello, I am a Sikh. So Sikh (sick) that I was admitted to Guru Nanak Hospital…” That joke came from a terminally ill patient who tackled the very serious subject of imminent death with a touch of comedy as part of a campaign called Last Laugh by the Indian Palliative Care Association (IAPC), aimed at creating awareness about end-of-life care. In another campaign by the IAPC, nurses and physicians discuss the various last words they have heard people utter. IAPC secretary Dr Abhijit Dam says, “The idea was to show that death isn’t taboo — it’s a matter of physiology, not pathology.” He argues that palliative care physicians need to know how to tackle the subject. “In our culture, talking about death is considered ‘ashudh’. That’s how we’ve been brought up, andyou can’t change culture overnight. You need to understand this to help your patients.”Palliative care physician Dr Sneha Rooh has her own way of dealing with questions of mortality. She hosts salon-style gatherings called ‘Death Cafés’. Twenty-seven such events have been held in cafes across the country. Dr Rooh says people’s reasons for coming differ — some are curious, others are grieving and some are simply looking for a place to crack a morbid joke. The Imphal-based doctor says hosting these events has made her think about her own mortality differently. “It puts things in perspective — I’ve learnt to have more fun and stopped striving to be the best professionally.”Tharun Bathini, 23, a graduate student who has attended some sessions is looking forward to the next one in Hyderabad because he recently worked with an NGO that works with HIV+ people. “I’ve been around a lot of death. I have so much to say,” he says.The conversations about death have also reached the screen. National award-winning filmmaker Aparna Sanyal recently made a documentary called One Mustard Seed which features intimate conversations with people who are terminally ill, or those who have experienced tremendous grief. At one point, the narrator of the documentary poignantly notes that clichéd phrases such as ‘sorry for your loss’ or ‘he’s in a better place’, “feel false because if I’m honest I know the minute I hear of death or anyone dying, I have already put myself in a little cocoon as though death were a disease that could spread by touch”.The film emerged from a death in her family, and Sanyal feels it is vital that we develop the ability to openly talk about death because it could make life a lot less complicated. “We shun anything that is dark because we crave light so much. But the trouble with that is that the moment life throws any difficulty our way, it breaks us and leaves us incapable of coping.”And as Michael Hebb, the founder of the death dinners concept, puts it: “Thinking and talking about death can identify how you want to live.”"

Unlike the students under the general category, the students applying under this category have one year age relaxation on the upper age limit. In the general category, the upper age limit for admission in nursery was four years.The online application process will be the same for the two categories but draw of lots will be conducted separately on February 21 for CWSN and on February 27 for the EWS/DG category.From this year, the Directorate of Education (DoE) has also removed the minimum three years residency period to be eligible to apply for admission under the category, in compliance with the order of the Delhi high court.Only the students applying under EWS category have to submit income certificates issued by the revenue department of Delhi. A person with less than one lakh income per annum is eligible to apply. The DoE has also spelt out that the students under DG and CWSN will not be required to submit income certificates.Scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, other backward classes (non-creamy layer), orphans, transgenders and all children living with or affected by HIV, shall be considered in the DG category. While for CWSN, the parents just have to submit disability certificates issued by a government hospital.This year, along with the 1,700 private schools under DoE, the private schools recognised by the municipal corporation will also be part of the online admission system. The corporation will be releasing a separate order for the same. Parents have been warned that they should desist from submitting the application multiple times, as it will lead to cancellation of candidature."

22 inmates at Pilibhit district jail test positive for HIV,2019-01-14,Pilibhit,"News,City News,Bareilly News","Pilibhit: Less than a year after 24 prisoners at Gorakhpur district jail tested positive for HIV, 22 inmates at Pilibhit district jail have tested positive to HIV. Pilibhit Jail superintendent Vivek Tripathi confirmed the development which has left the prison department embarrassed.“We will have to look into each of the specific case based on date of their admission and the time they were detected positive for HIV,” Sharad Kulshrestha, additional inspector general (prison), said.This development comes amid four inmates of the district jail succumbing to various ailments in the past two months. They were shifted to the district hospital in critical conditions.“A medical check-up of every jail inmate is done at the time he or she is lodged. However, this medical report does not ascertain the HIV status of the prisoner,” additional IG (prison) Kulshrestha said. This makes things difficult for prison officials to ascertain if the inmate was HIV positive before he was lodged in the prison or he was infected inside the premises.After the Gorakhpur incident last year where 24 prison inmates were tested positive for HIV, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) had directed the prison department to take immediate preventive measures so that other prisoners do not fall prey to the infection and those were suffering are provided necessary medical treatment.“Weight of each inmate is measured periodically and if any alarming decrease in a prisoner's weight is detected he/she is referred to the prison hospital. Inmates detected with HIV positive are registered at anti-retroviral therapy (ATR) centres in district hospitals,” Kulshrestha said.In a test conducted at 70 jails of UP till December 2017, a total of 265 were tested positive for HIV. Senior officials, however, claim that 250-odd HIV positive inmates across UP jails is not an alarming figure. “With approximately 1 lakh inmates in jails across UP, 265 HIV positive is not an alarming figure. These inmates are immediately registered with ATR centres on diagnosis,” the additional IG (prison) said."
"Techie forum does 16,000 blood donations in 5 years",2019-01-15,Thiruvananthapuram,"News,City News,Thiruvananthapuram News","Thiruvananthapuram: Tejus, a blood donation forum of techies, has crossed a milestone recently with by facilitating 16,000 blood donations in five years. Setting the bars high, Tejus is planning to achieve 12,000 donations this year alone.Formed by a group of techies with the aim of promoting and facilitating voluntary blood donation, Tejus is a major contact point for blood requirements. “Our vision 2020 is to make institutions such as Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology and Regional Cancer Centre meet their blood requirements through voluntary donation,” said Tejus co-founder Brijesh P I.Around 95% of the total blood donations were by techies. Tejus had conducted around 72 camps at Technopark last year alone. Being funded by like-minded individuals and CSR of corporate firms, Tejus has been very active in organizing blood donation programmes to meet the growing requirement for blood. It is now planning to create more awareness programmes for voluntary blood donations. “People are more aware of voluntary blood donation when they experience a need for their own family members. Many dengue cases reported last year and the subsequent demand for blood have created increased awareness among the public,” he said.Brijesh said that the daily requirement for blood donation in the city alone was 500 units. He said that blood donation was a win-win situation for all. “Donor will get a detailed understanding of their health through this. It will be clear if they have any kind of health issues ranging from blood pressure to HIV,” he said."
Nursing students lack AIDS awareness,2018-10-22,Vijayawada,"News,City News,Vijayawada News","Vijayawada: In a shocking finding, it has emerged that over 50% of nursing students believe that they might contract HIV if they are exposed to HIV/AIDS patients at the workplace while over 20% of them believe that they should be given the right to refuse treatment to HIV/AIDS patients.In a recent research paper published in the Dr NTRUHS quarterly journal, it is said that despite having good knowledge regarding HIV, negative attitudes towards HIV/AIDS patients are still prevalent among a large number of nursing students.“The stigma around HIV/AIDS in the medical community is not as severe now as it used to be a decade ago. However, the need to educate young nurses on the issue is made clear in the study,” said Dr Samaram, sexologist and former national president of the Indian Medical Association.The study also revealed that over 60% of the students said they were worried about touching AIDS patients, despite knowing well that skin contact does not lead to the spread of the disease.Dr Samaram stressed that no doctor or nurse should deny treatment to an HIV patient as it is against medical ethics and human rights of the patients. “The precautions you take to treat HIV patients is not different from that of any other patient. The phobia around this should be driven away,” he said.Dr Samaram also added that a patient need not reveal his HIV status to the nurse for treatment.Some students believed that the virus can be spread through mosquito bites and urine. Over 50% did not know that tattooing could cause HIV infections.The study was conducted in four nursing colleges wherein 800 students participated and nearly 200 students did not show willingness to participate in the study."

PG student wins big at national-level event,2018-10-30,AURANGABAD,"News,City News,Aurangabad News","AURANGABAD: Ashish Rajan, a first-year post-graduation student of the geriatrics department at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) won the first prize in paper presentation at the 15th International Conference on Geriatric Care and Gerontology (GSICON 2018) held in Pune on October 27 and 28.Under the guidance of the HoD of geriatrics, Mangala Borkar, and associate professor Shailaja Rao, Rajan had undertaken research on HIV positive cases first diagnosed in the geriatric age.The annual conference of the Geriatric Society of India (GSI), GSICON, was jointly organized by the Pune chapter of the Society and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune on the theme ‘getting old is mandatory, feeling old is optional’.International faculty Tahir Masud and the general secretary of the GSI, OP Sharma, were present.Rajan presented a paper on the retrospective study done, which was based on the records of the ART PLUS Centre at GMCH, to assess the clinical profile of newly-diagnosed HIV positive geriatric patients.Explaining the study, the PG student says that the HIV infection is common in the younger age group (under 45 years). However, there are geriatric patients who are HIV positive. “Some may have being diagnosed in their late 40s or 50s and are surviving in their 60s due to good management. A few may have been diagnosed for the first time at the age of 60 or above. This study consists of the latter group,” Rajan states.The paper states that many older individuals lack knowledge about safe sex and perceive themselves to be at a low risk. “The testing rate among them is lower and they often present at a late stage. Drug therapy of both age related co-morbidities and HIV can increase the side effects.”The study shows that 2.96% patients were diagnosed for HIV for the first time at a geriatric age. “Many elderly individuals may be sexually active and need to be educated about HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in a tactful and discreet manner,” the research concludes. Mahesh Patil and Zeba Firdous contributed to the study. Patil had also presented a poster on the screening of geriatric patients for dementia at the event."

The 63-yearold woman was admitted to the hospital with a fractured femur, for which she needs to undergo surgery. While the son claimed doctors had suspended treatment after learning that she was HIV positive, hospital authorities denied the charge and said the treatment had got prolonged due to other health issues of the woman.The patient, a Beliaghata resident, was admitted to Unit-V of the orthopaedic surgery department on October 5 after she fell down at her home.“All investigations prior to the surgery were done. But the doctors stopped her treatment after they came to know about her HIV status. They do not want to take up the surgery,” alleged one of her sons.The hospital refuted the allegations and said the patient was being tended to with conservative treatment. According to the doctors, the patient needs hip replacement surgery that must be done under anesthesia . But the patient has other health issues, including chest ailment and psychiatric problems. “We have to wait for anaesthesia clearance due to these conditions,” a doctor said.“The allegations are baseless. We conduct surgeries on HIV-positive patients on regular basis. So why we would we deny medical care to this particular patient. The reasons for the delay in the surgery are technical and has nothing to do with her being HIV positive,” said Dr Dwipayan Biswas, deputy medical superintendent at NRSMCH.The patient’s family had lodged a formal complaint on October 12 with the hospital authority. The hospital administration claimed that the family was explained about the delay in taking up the surgery.“My mother is lying on a hospital bed without any treatment. Doctors have told us to take her back home after they came to know that she is HIV status positive,” alleged her elder son."

"Swine flu claims 7 in 11 days, NMC has no vaccine since July",2018-11-01,Nagpur,"News,City News,Nagpur News","Nagpur: Swine flu , also known as H1N1 flu virus, is on the rampage in the city. In last 11 days, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has registered seven deaths and 42 positive cases.What is more shocking is the fact that civic body is not having H1N1 vaccine, which is critical for sensitive patients as well as paramedical staff, since June 30.As per NMC records, there were 12 deaths and 78 positive cases of swine flu by October 20 and the number has increased to 19 deaths and 120 positive cases as on October 31.Of the total 19 deaths, five were from the city and the remaining 14 from other parts of Vidarbha and adjoining states. Similarly, 47 of the total 120 positive cases are from the city and the remaining 73 from other parts of Vidarbha and adjoining states. But all deaths occurred and positive cases registered and underwent treatment in the city itself.As on August 31, there were only 2 deaths and 10 positive cases. The number of patients increased in last two months of which a majority were reported in October.If compared with past records, the incidence of the disease this year is third highest in the recent few years. The virus had claimed 55 lives in 2014-15 and 37 in 2017-18. Positive cases were 328 in 2017-18 and 325 in 2014-15.Most worrying factor is that the number of patients will increase in winter if preventive measures are neglected.President of Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) Dr Nikhil Balankhe told TOI the cases are likely to increase as this virus is more active during winter. “Cases will continue till Holi (March) and come down with the rise in temperature. Need is to take preventive measures. People with cough should ensure covering face. Each and every one should ensure washing hands thoroughly before consuming anything. There are more such preventive measures that can help in controlling the spread of the virus,” he said.Balankhe added mass awareness is also the need of the hour. “SCCM has organized an interaction programme between people and medical experts from 5pm to 7pm on November 18 at Chitnavis Centre. Experts will answer all queries related to swine flu as well as dengue or scrub typhus,” he said.Surprisingly, though the NMC has continued distribution of Tami Flu tablets, it does not have H1N1 influenza virus vaccine since June 30.An NMC official says the vaccine is awaited from the state government. “Tami Flu is given to suspected patients and to persons who come in contact with such patients. Vaccine is necessary for pregnant, hypersensitive, HIV etc patients. Also, vaccine is given to paramedical staff for prevention,” the official said.“In view of the increase in the number of patients, the NMC also plans to purchase the vaccine on its own as soon as possible without waiting for the supply from the government,” the official said.Many cities in the state, including Pune, Nashik, Pimpri Chinchwad, Aurangabad etc, have been affected by swine flu."

The convict is HIV-positive and unemployed. He used to rape the girl when her mother went to work. The minor girl has not contracted HIV despite being raped by an infected person from 2008 to 2014 in their house in Sachin area of the city. The convict had divorced his wife to get married to the rape survivor’s mother.He started raping the girl when she was a student of class VI.

Tuberculosis: Intensive TB drive to screen 1.10cr high-risk people in state,2018-11-05,PUNE,"News,City News,Pune News,Civic Issues","PUNE: An intensive door-to-door campaign to detect unreported tuberculosis (TB) cases will be undertaken across the state, including in Pune, between November 12 and November 24.The state health department aims to screen roughly 1.10 crore high-risk individuals in the state’s 36 districts — in rural and urban areas — during the second phase of the ‘active TB patient finding campaign’ this year. The officials expect to detect around 7,000 new patients and put them on treatment. Around 10,000 health workers and community volunteers will be engaged in the massive screening activity.“The high-risk individuals living in urban slums, orphanages as well as street dwellers, construction-site workers, former TB patients, HIV-infected persons, diabetics and the malnourished population will be among those who will be screened,” said public health expert Padmaja Jogewar, joint director (TB) in the state health department.The active case finding campaign began in the state in 2017. Three door-to-door campaigns were conducted in 2017, which led to the diagnosis of 4,000 “hidden” patients in the community and put them on treatment. This is the second such campaign this year. The first campaign was held across the state in January. The health officials had detected 1,600 new TB patients during the drive in January.“The proportion of TB cases identified during these campaigns may appear to be on the lower side, but such drives are crucial for early case detection and breaking the chain of TB infection transmission. Moreover, the drives help in educating people and creating mass awareness about TB in the community,” said Sanjeev Kamble, a senior public health expert and the director of the state health department.In view of the Union government’s aim to put an end to TB by 2025, such aggressive and proactive innovative initiatives are need of the day, he added.The exercise to detect TB is being carried out mainly in high-risk areas with vulnerable populations. “We collect sputum samples of suspected patients on the spot and send them to nearby microscopy centres for free microscopy testing. Suspected patients are also given free x-rays and advanced diagnostics as per the requirement,” another state health official said.The WHO says 2.1% of all new TB cases in India are multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis cases. Also, almost 15% of TB patients receiving re-treatment are developing MDR-TB. Undiagnosed and mistreated cases continue to drive the epidemic in India. In 2010, there were around 2.3 million TB cases with 360,000 deaths reported.Around 1,000 people die of TB every day. Nearly one in six deaths among people aged 15-49 is due to TB.Nearly 100,000 cases of serious MDR-TB are estimated to occur in the country annually, and each case costs more than Rs 1 lakh to be diagnosed and treated."
"Diseases contracted after health policy purchase should be covered, suggests Irdai panel",2018-11-05,"New Delhi, Nov 5 () Chronic diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, AIDs/HIV infection and Morbid obesity should be covered under medical cover if a person contracts such ailments after buying a health insurance policy, according to recommendations of a panel set up by Irdai.

The working group has also suggested a list of 17 diseases, including chronic kidney disease, Hepatitis B, Alzheimer's, epilepsy and HIV & AIDS, which could be excluded from health insurance polices.

Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) had set up a working group for standardisation of exclusions in health insurance contracts in July this year.

The panel has submitted its report containing host of recommendations to the regulator.

""The Working Group recommends that all health conditions acquired after policy inception, other than those that are not covered under the policy contract (such as Infertility and Maternity) should be covered under the policy and cannot be permanently excluded.

""Thus, exclusion of diseases contracted after taking the health insurance policy such as for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AIDs/HIV infection, Morbid obesity, etc, cannot be permitted,"" said the report placed on the Irdai's website.

It has initially recommended a ""list of 17 conditions"" for which insurers can incorporate permanent exclusions if they are pre-existing at the time of underwriting.

""It is suggested a standard format of consent letter to be given by the proposer may be specified,"" the report said.

The panel also noted that non-declaration/ misrepresentation of material facts is a major concern in health insurance contracts.

There may be cases where major ailments are detected as pre-existing during 4th or 5th renewal when a person is admitted for some other ailment.

""As a practice insurer may generally invoke the cancellation clause for non-disclosure/ misrepresentation,"" said the panel.

In such cases, if the non-disclosed condition is from the list of the permanent exclusions, the insurer can take a consent from the insured person and permanently exclude the condition and continue with the policy.

If the non-disclosed condition is other than from the list of permanent exclusions, then the insurer can incorporate additional waiting period for the maximum period of 4 years from the date of detection.

During the waiting period, claims are not admissible.

The group further recommended a moratorium period of 8 years of continuous renewals, after which the claim shall not be questioned based on non-disclosures or misrepresentations at the time of taking the policy.

""This would mean the policy would be incontestable in terms of application of any exclusions except for proven fraud as well as permanent exclusions specified in a policy contract,"" the report said.

Another recommendation is that the exclusions applied by insurers for alcohol and substance abuse must be reviewed and standardised.

""This exclusion shall be modified to exclude only treatments for alcoholism and drug or substance abuse unless associated with mental illness,"" it has suggested.

As per the report, the working group felt that with advancement in technologies as well as covers, the policies are moving from hospitalisation insurance policies to comprehensive coverage, including outpatient.

Hence, to enhance transparency and increase the understanding to the policyholders, it is suggested that insurers start adopting an explanation of benefits (EOB) in their collaterals as well as policy schedule / wordings which would be easily understandable by the customers.

There are about 27 General Insurance Companies, 24 Life Insurance companies and seven Standalone Health Insurance companies in India. Health insurance is mainly transacted by the General Insurance and the Health Insurance companies while Life Insurers transact long term benefit policies.

Careers out of curiosity,2018-10-07,BENGALURU,"News,City News,Bengaluru News","BENGALURU: When he was a student in St Stephens, Ashok Alexander went up to the captain of the chess team and asked him for a game, explaining that he had learnt how to play. The captain looked him up and down, and said “I don’t play with beginners.”Eight months later, Alexander was ranked fourth in the Delhi championships, and he had defeated the captain twice. “In college, all I wanted to do was play chess. My academic record was good, but my chess performances were better. I even considered dropping out of college in my third year, to play chess full time, but better counsel prevailed,” he laughs.Alexander’s father was PC Alexander, the IAS officer who later became Indira Gandhi’s principal secretary, the governor of Tamil Nadu and then Maharashtra, and was proposed by AB Vajpayee’s government as their nominee for president of India. His presidency was opposed by the Congress party. “My father’s career saw many highs, but it also saw some tremendous lows. Even back then, there were times when his career was almost wrecked. And though it was my father’s fond hope that I would follow in his footsteps and become an IAS officer, I was sure that I did not want to get into government service. A number of things happened which convinced me that I did not want to be at the mercy of politicians – and frankly, I did not want to be a bureaucrat. I wanted to avoid the IAS at all costs,” Alexander laughs.There were other experiences that shaped the young Alexander when he was growing up. In 1963, his father was posted to New York, working at the UN. The family moved with him, and they stayed there for four years. “I still remember the dates,” says Alexander. We landed in New York on October 15th, 1963. On 22 November, that year, President John F Kennedy was assassinated. Less than three months later, The Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan show,” he says.Alexander went to an international school in New York, growing up when the country was undergoing a period of dramatic social change. It was the time of the Vietnam War – with carnage on TV every night. It was the time of student protests against the war. It was a time of flower power and the British invasion, with bands like the Rolling Stones and the Kinks and the Animals and the Yardbirds dominating the charts. And it was also the time of the space race, as the US and the USSR vied for supremacy, and the Indian teen covered his wall with posters of astronauts and spacecraft.But those days had to come to an end. In 1967, PC Alexander decided to return to India. “He was bored. He was finishing his work for the day in two to three hours. And this was anathema to a man who worked almost to the point of collapse when he was in India,” says Alexander.“I was shocked,” he says. Then, he pauses, and reflects. “My father’s career is full of incidents where he gave up what was a comfortable, well paying position, to take up something that he felt he had to do. The pattern seems to have repeated itself in my life as well,” he says.After completing his economics degree from St Stephens, Alexander followed it up with a masters from the Delhi School of Economics, and a Postgraduate Diploma in Management from IIM, Ahmedabad. From IIMA, Alexander joined Price Waterhouse, and did well there. He was posted to Hong Kong, but work still took second place to chess. “It was at one of those chess competitions that I met someone who was working for McKinsey. Now, people who play chess have a reputation for intelligence, but few people realize that chess intelligence doesn’t translate well to real life,” he says, with a twinkle in his eye. “But this person convinced me that I would fit in well at McKinsey. So I applied, flew down to New York, attended a series of interviews and was selected,” he says.But it wasn’t smooth sailing at McKinsey for Alexander. “I was assigned to a project on reinsurance, and I didn’t know anything about it. I also did not get along well with my engagement manager, and at the end of the year, I got a report which began with the words “Good news”, but also included the line “He still has to demonstrate that he has the ability and virtue of teamwork required to succeed in the Firm”. I was quite happy with the report, but when I showed it to others — including my father — their reaction was one of shock. “This means that you are going to be fired if this happens again,” said a colleague.That was the beginning of a dark period for Alexander, but he slowly changed the negative first impression by working tirelessly on a project that no one else wanted, working through a freezing Colorado winter. As his reputation turned around, he also began evangelizing the idea of a McKinsey operation in India. “It was clear that my IIM classmates were as good, if not better that the Harvard types that worked in McKinsey in those days.”McKinsey set up shop in India just as liberalization transformed the country’s economy, and Alexander thrived, ultimately heading the consultancy’s operations in Delhi. And then, Bill Gates visited India. The Gates Foundation was attempting to tackle the problem of HIV , and Alexander accompanied him. Fascinated with the scope of the problem, he left McKinsey to join the Gates Foundation in India. During his nine years as the head of the Gates Foundation in India, he designed and implemented the highly regarded Avahan programme. “Working with the Gates Foundation, I realized that the money, the glamour, all of that was an illusion. I realized that I had to give something back. I really wasn’t prepared for what I would see on the ground. The poverty, the terrible state of a country that I hadn’t really been aware of. It changed me. Some things that I took from McKinsey were my training in problem identification and solving, and it is something that is lacking in many areas of the social sector. Now, Alexander is running his own NGO , the Antara foundation, which works on improving maternal and child health outcomes. “It’s a far cry from working with the Gates Foundation. There we disbursed 370 million dollars over ten years. Now I’m grateful for a donation of a few lakh rupees,” he says.He stops, and thinks for a few seconds. “It’s the steepest learning curve that I have ever encountered he says. But that’s what keeps me going.”"
MSRTC approves free travel for former MLAs,2018-10-08,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: The cash strapped Maharashtra state road transport corporation (MSRTC) has approved free travel for current and former MLA's their wives or any one member on any of the state transport buses Transport minister Diwakar Raote said that this is being done to attract these elected representatives to travel using the state transport buses. ""This will send a positive message to the public,"" said Raote. However all the MLA's and former MLA's must carry their ID cards with them to avail the concession.Just last week the state cabinet had passed a proposal giving concessions to several groups in the state. This proposal has added a burden of Rs 1800 crore on the corporation which currently has a yearly loss of Rs 2500 crore. Free travel has been extended to girl students from rural areas till they complete 12 standard, currently this service is only available for girl students till the complete 10 standard.The senior citizens can now avail 45 per cent concession in air conditioned Shiv Shahi buses as well. Till date, senior citizens were provided 50 per cent concession for state transport buses and semi-luxury buses. The patients suffering cancer, TB would be provided 75 per cent concession as against 50 per cent given so far. Patients of Sickle-cell anemia, haemophilia and HIV can travel free of cost."
Modern humans inherited viral defences from Neanderthals,2018-10-09,"poison

BOSTON",News,"poison

BOSTON: Modern humans inherited genetic defences against viral diseases like hepatitis and influenza from Neanderthals, when the two species interbred 50,000 years ago, a study has found.Neanderthals mysteriously disappeared about 40,000 years ago, but before vanishing they interbred with another human species that was just beginning its global spread.As a result of these ancient trysts, many modern Europeans and Asians today harbour about two per cent of Neanderthal DNA in their genomes.""Our research shows that a substantial number of frequently occurring Neanderthal DNA snippets were adaptive for a very cool reason,"" said Dmitri Petrov, a professor at Stanford University in the US.""Neanderthal genes likely gave us some protection against viruses that our ancestors encountered when they left Africa,"" said Petrov.""It made much more sense for modern humans to just borrow the already adapted genetic defences from Neanderthals rather than waiting for their own adaptive mutations to develop, which would have taken much more time,"" said David Enard, a former postdoctoral fellow at Petrov's lab.The findings, published in the journal Cell, are consistent with a '-antidote' model of gene swapping between two species. In this scenario, Neanderthals bequeathed to modern humans not only infectious viruses but also the genetic tools to combat the invaders.""Modern humans and Neanderthals are so closely related that it really wasn't much of a genetic barrier for these viruses to jump,"" said Enard, who is now an assistant professor at the University of Arizona.""But that closeness also meant that Neanderthals could pass on protection against those viruses to us,"" Enard said.In the study, scientists show that the genetic defences that Neanderthals passed to us were against RNA viruses, which encode their genes with RNA, a molecule that is chemically similar to DNA. The scientists reached their conclusions after compiling a list of more than 4,500 genes in modern humans that are known to interact in some way with viruses.Enard then checked his list against a database of sequenced Neanderthal DNA and identified 152 fragments of those genes from modern humans that were also present in Neanderthals.The scientists showed that in modern humans, the 152 genes we inherited from Neanderthals interact with modern day HIV, influenza A and hepatitis C -- all types of RNA virus.From this, researchers concluded that these genes helped our ancestors fend off ancient RNA viruses that they encountered upon leaving Africa.The Neanderthal genes they identified are present only in modern Europeans, suggesting that different viruses influenced genetic swapping between Neanderthals and the ancient ancestors of today's Asians.Interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans is thought to have occurred multiple times and in multiple locales throughout prehistory, and different viruses were likely involved in each instance.The findings show that it is possible to comb through a species' genome and find evidence of ancient diseases that once afflicted it -- even when the viruses responsible for those diseases are long gone.This technique would work especially well for RNA viruses, whose RNA-based genomes are more frail than their DNA counterparts, Enard said."
Rehab staff held for selling drugs in Delhi: Rehab centre staff held for selling drugs in Delhi,2018-10-10,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Delhi News,Crime","NEW DELHI: A sociology graduate and another employee of a drug treatment and rehabilitation centre run by an NGO were arrested on Tuesday for peddling banned buprenorphine The NGO used to get buprenorphine consignments for free treatment of inmates from NACO (National AIDS Control Organization). The employee, Franklin Lazarus, was caught with 3,800 buprenorphine tablets from a bus stop near Vasant Kunj. During interrogation, he led Crime Branch to Manish Mehta, the store manager at the NGO, who was also the mastermind.Additional CP (crime) Ajit K Singla said Lazarus, also an addict, had approached Mehta with a proposal to sell government-approved stock, to which he agreed. “A team led by DCP (crime) Bhisham Singh and ACP Aditya Gautam recovered 3,800 tablets of buprenorphine from them meant to be sold to a supplier,” said Singla.The NGO had bagged the project called harm reduction programme for drug addicts from NACO to help addicts reduce the use of syringe, which they even shared with others. Buprenorphine tablets were provided to them as an alternate to syringes and also to reduce HIV risk.“The accused sold each strip for Rs 200 and made a good sum by selling it in open market,” said DCP Singh. Police said Lazarus had worked as a counsellor at de-addiction centers in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. He had been working at the Delhi centre for the past 12 years. He used his experience to set up a supply chain for the diverted buprenorphine. Mehta worked on different projects with the NGO and held different posts. He was currently handling the de-addiction programme."
"section 377: Freed from Section 377, their gender identity is still shackled",2018-10-10,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Delhi News,Civic Issues","NEW DELHI: After the Supreme Court judgment decriminalised Section 377 , 21-year-old Fradish thought he would finally be able to declare himself free of his biological identity as male and proclaim to the world that he feels like a woman and would rather assert himself as transgender. Over a month after the judgment, Fradish may have overcome the fear of persecution under Section 377, but her family in her village in Haryana is just not ready for the public assertion of identity.Like her many others from the LGBTQ community are suddenly facing a backlash from the mainstream where the assertion of identity is inviting more overt discrimination and even violence. Parents and relatives are finding it harder to allow them the freedom to choose their identity. At a ‘Lok Panchayat’ in the capital on the way forward on inclusion and mainstreaming the LGBTQ community, it came through that the society is yet to welcome in its midst sexual minorities and gender identities that do not conform to regular heterosexual paradigm.So, one found Fradish, a graduate, arriving at ‘The Constitution Club’ — the venue for the brainstorming as a male and then changing clothes to assume the identity of the woman she wants to be. “When the judgment came I was elated and started posting congratulatory messages on social media. After the initial positivity one saw people attacking us with jokes and filthy messages. It saddened me. Even my relatives and people living in the neighbourhood rebuked me citing the judgment. They said that now I have got the passport to do all these dirty things,” Fradish shared.“I know I can now assert my identity but I feel family support is most important. When I recently opened up to my mother I tried to keep it simple by saying I am gay but she refused to understand. She insisted that I am male because I was born a male. If they can’t accept me even as gay how can I tell them that I actually want to be a woman and I dress in clothes meant for women away from home,” Fradish pointed.“Over the last month we have received at least seven cases where LGBTQ community members reported some sort of violence faced by them on account of their identity. We feel these cases are coming now because with the fear of Section 377 gone the LGBTQ community members are more confident about coming out and opening up about their identity. However, society is not yet sensitised enough to respond to the mainstreaming hence the backlash,” Rohit Sarkar from India HIV/AIDS Alliance shared. He pointed that this information is coming through interactions with community under Samarth programme wherein HIV testing is conducted across seven cities including Delhi, Jalandhar (Punjab), Baroda (Gujarat), Hassan (Karnataka), Shrirampur (West Bengal), Hyderabad (Telangana) and Pune (Maharashtra).At the Lok Panchayat organised by Humsafar Trust with support from other LGBTQ community alliances, most felt that the roadmap for the future must focus on how to deal with discrimination in various settings such as housing, health, property, employment and education. The conversation around need for inclusive laws has started gaining ground.Transgender rights activist Abhina Aher said reaching out to political parties at this point was necessary. “We now need to ask all political parties what is their stand on our rights and will they include LGBTQ community in their manifesto for 2019?” They also sought to step up work towards seeking legal rights to marriage, adoption and property.Transgender rights activist and consultant with United Nations Development Programme, Zainab Patel drew attention to the importance of the workplace in transforming attitudes. “We spend a major part of our waking hours at the workplace. So, it is important that the private and public sector makes space for different gender identities. Once this happens automatically acceptance will come. Also public spaces and public modes of transport need to be more equal,” Patel said. She feels the onus on mainstreaming is on both the government and civil society. “The SC judgment talks of ensuring equality and so the government needs to get down to making it happen,” she added."

"2 patients allege Davanagere hospital issued false HIV-positive reports, file plaints",2018-10-03,BENGALURU,"News,City News,Bengaluru News,Crime","BENGALURU: A labourer and a homemaker have filed separate complaints with the health department against a Davanagere private hospital for allegedly giving them false HIV-positive reports . They claim the revelation turned their lives upside down, causing them mental agony and pushing them into depression.Halappa KB, 60, and Sushmitha, 21, are residents of Davanagere. Halappa, a labourer, got admitted to City Central Hospital in December 2017 for acute leg pain, followed by blockage in his veins. He alleged that no consent was taken from him for the HIV test nor was he informed while his blood was being drawn. His son Raju H is now running from pillar to post seeking justice and has complained to the consumer court as well, claiming that his father had to face stigma due to the false positive reports.“The hospital conducted an HIV test without our knowledge and consent. It claimed that the report was positive and refused to conduct cardiac surgery on my father. He slipped into depression and even attempted suicide. We brought him to a private hospital in Bengaluru and got him tested for HIV. But the report was negative and he even underwent the operation. My complaint to the health department has been ignored and justice has been delayed,” Raju told TOI.Sushmitha had visited the Davanagere hospital in March for a prenatal check-up when she was five months pregnant. “The blood test was done on March 23. But they asked us to collect the report after three days. We were shocked with the findings — they showed she was HIV-positive — and underwent stress and psychological trauma,” said her husband Prahlad S, a police constable.The couple then went to the government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre for HIV testing. Till then, they had no idea that the report issued by the private hospital was false. “ICTC’s report revealed Sushmitha was not HIV-positive, which came as a huge relief. But the private hospital was firm on its stand. If they had a doubt, they should have conducted another test,” said Prahlad. Sushmitha’s medical negligence complaint with the health department is pending inquiry. Prahlad added that the hospital didn’t even bother to counsel them when they were traumatised after seeing the report.Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere, said he was asked by the district health officer to inquire into both the complaints. “In Halappa’s case, the inquiry report has been submitted to the government, but the findings can’t be disclosed. In the other case, the inquiry is yet to begin,” he said.When TOI contacted the hospital authorities, they refused to comment but neither denied nor admitted to the allegations. “The cases are pending before the consumer court. At this stage, we can’t comment on the complaints. We have cooperated with the health department for the inquiry,” said Padmanabh UR, administrator, City Central Hospital.In 2017, the state witnessed a series of protests by doctors when the government initiated amendments to the Karnataka Private Medical Establishment (KPME) Act to regulate private medical establishments. Though the amendments were made, they were called the watered-down version of those intended. In the two cases, the patients have sought action under the KPME Act. “But the Act authorises us only to check and take measures if a hospital/clinic is functioning without registration. Medical negligence cases don’t come under it,” said Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere."
transgenders: Transgenders organize a festival for everyone,2018-10-03,KOLKATA,"News,City News,Kolkata News","KOLKATA: The city’s transgender community is organizing an all-inclusive Durga Puja, where everyone, including members of the LGBTQI community and others marginalized in society will come together to celebrate the festival.The small-budget Puja on Gokhale Road will have an ardhanarishwar idol (half female and half male), to be moulded by transpersons and even the rites will be performed by a transgender priest. Taking cue from the ethos of Navratri festival, which coincides with Durga Puja, the celebration will be joined by members of nine marginalized sections, such as the HIV-affected, sex workers, streetchildren and senior citizens at old age homes.The Puja in a 9ftX9ft space inside the residence of Ranjita alias Ranjit Sinha, member of West Bengal Transgender Board, portrays a gamut of metaphors questioning the practice of the class structure that has traditionally barred transgenders and other minorities from taking part in big socio-religious events, such as the Puja.For instance, the idol is being created by transmen, guided by Kumartuli artist Biswanath Pal. “There is a twist in this tale of the deity coming alive in the hands of my transmen brothers who were born women but have opted for manhood by choice. This is our way of questioning patriarchy and mainstream hegemony,” Sinha said. “The overpowering brahminical or the upper-strata muscle flexing that is often associated with the Pujas sometimes end in isolating a whole lot of people from the festive spirit. We want them to be a part of our Puja, everyone from gay, lesbian, bisexual to the heterosexual... and not just the gender variants, but all sorts of underprivileged sections who are confronted with contemptuous gaze of revellers whenever they enter a pandal,” said Joe Tapashi Dutta. The Puja, dedicated to the marginalized, will have a Kumari Puja, where 20 streetkids will be part of.The idol is being fashioned after the composite androgynous form of Shiva and Parvati. “The embodiment of ardhanarishwar, where both Shiv and Shakti fused into each other to become one, is truly the transgender deity,” Sinha said.A week before Mahalaya, Kabirag alias Ketaki Poddar paints the eyes of idol. “Why should we stay away from this festival, which is apparently ‘sarbajanin’ (everyone’s)?” said Kabirag, who will perform the puja. This priest will be a Vaishnav one, clad in dhoti and sporting tilak and a tulsi-beaded chain.The idea struck the “other” men and women soon after the September-6 apex court judgment, decriminalizing gay sex. “It was a natural outcome of the Supreme Court striking down Section 377 of the IPC,” said Anuradha alias Animesh Sarkar. “The SC order symbolizes change, from a tradition that bestowed the d”ecision-making powers on the mainstream and the powerful.” About the venue being her own home, Sinha said, “As the Puja was planned in a hurry, we couldn’t find a bigger venue. From next year, we’ll be better organized.”India’s first transgender college principal Manabi Bandopadhyay called the Puja “unique”. “Transgenders are Durga themselves, so it will be Durgas worshipping Durga,” she said."
"Lab technician tries to sneak drug into Bhondsi jail, held",2018-10-05,GURUGRAM,"News,City News,Gurgaon News","GURUGRAM: A lab technician, who had gone to collect blood samples of newly arrived inmates at Bhondsi jail , was arrested for carrying sulfa, a type of drug , inside the prison premises.Police said 35 grams of sulfa was found on Mamraj during frisking at the jail entrance around 5.30pm on Wednesday. Preliminary investigation revealed that he used to visit the jail regularly and supply narcotics to inmates.Apart from Mamraj, undertrial inmate Pradeep, for whom the narcotic was brought inside the jail, has also been booked under relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and the Prisons Act.Police said as per the guidelines, every inmate is tested for HIV when he is brought to the jail and Mamraj was the man who would visit the prisons to collect the blood samples. On Wednesday, Mamraj entered the jail as usual to collect blood samples of some new inmates. However, while frisking at the entry gate, a jail warden found 35 grams sulfa in his possession.“During interrogation, he revealed that he was carrying the drug for Pradeep, an undertrial (for some petty crimes),” said spokesperson for Gurugram police Subhash Bokan.SHO Umesh Kumar of Bhondsi police station said Mamraj had been taken in custody following a complaint filed by the jail authorities. “A FIR was registered against the accused under relevant sections. The lab technician will be produced in court on Friday,” said Kumar, adding they were investigating the case to find who all were involved in this racket.On September 27, eight cannabis tablets and three grams of sulfa-like drug were seized from an inmate, when he was brought to the jail after being produced in a court.In June, a volunteer jail warder was arrested with 20 grams of opium, four cellphones, one battery and two phone chargers during a surprise check.In the same month, the jail authorities had seized 65 grams of sulfonamide, a broken phone charger and a cigarette rolling paper from a white polythene bag suspended from a boundary wall in the jail complex. In November 2017, around 80 gram of sulfa was recovered from a prisoner, Amit Kumar."
Nearly 2% blood donors in India have infection,2018-10-05,Nagpur,"News,City News,Nagpur News","Nagpur: Blood transfusion services (BTS) in India are neither safe nor adequate. About 1.7 to 2% blood donors are infected with either hepatitis B/C, HIV, syphilis or malaria etc. Hence, there is need to promote the concept of Repeat Regular Blood Donor (RRBD) for safe blood availability. Also, to create uniform blood quality, there is need for a centralized blood banking system — the ‘Hub and Spoke’ model of blood banks.“Basic purpose of BTS is to provide adequate and safe blood to the needy. In developed world, almost 4 to 6% of the population donates blood. But in India this figure is just about 0.8 to 0.9%. As per World Health Organization (WHO), at least 2% of the population should donate blood annually to bridge the demand-supply gap,” said Dr Harish Warbhe, who owns Lifeline Blood Bank.India has 2,800 blood banks whereas the US has just 13 and rest there are satellite centres of these banks. The US model is called ‘Hub and Spoke’ model whereas the Indian BTS services are fragmented. Because of centralized services, blood quality in the US is uniform while in India the quality is very good in some banks, moderate in others and bad in a majority. In fact, in rural parts either there is no blood or the quality of blood is unsafe, Dr Warbhe said.Dr Warbhe says, “In developed world nowhere whole blood is given to any patient. Everyone gets only the required blood component. In India, this is not the case as only 40-50% patients are given blood components and the remaining get whole blood. This is sheer waste of precious blood. One donor can serve three patients by giving components. Also, in whole blood transfusion, there are ample chances of transfusion-related adverse reactions.”In the West, there is a concept of RRBD which means that same donor donates repeatedly. Since the donor is tested for infections every time, chances of him/her carrying any infections are almost ruled out increasing the safety aspect. In India, most blood donors are generally first-time donors or unaware of the infections they may be carrying.Another factor which ensures blood quality is the use of latest techniques for testing. Generally only Elisa, spot or rapid test is conducted to check infections while the need is for a robust and sensitive NAT (nucleic acid test or nucleic acid amplification) testing.Dr Ravi Wankhede of Jeevan Jyoti Blood Bank insists that to increase blood donation, stress should be laid on donation by persons in government service. “In the West, prime ministers and presidents also donate blood regularly when it is due without any hue and cry. But in India not even a corporator donates blood,” he said."
‘Govt must extend facilities to LGBTQ’,2018-10-05,NAGPUR,,"NAGPUR: People should first be humane to each other and not judge anyone on the basis of their sexual preferences, said Nikunj Joshi, LGBTQ activist and CEO of Saarthi Trust on Wednesday.Speaking at a panel discussion on ‘Homosexuality: Changing attitude: Supreme Court and Society’, organized by Press Club of Nagpur in the wake of the historic Supreme Court judgment to decriminalize gay sex.“Though section 377 has been struck down, there still exists a social stigma around homosexuals and transgenders. This could be wiped out by creating awareness as people usually confuse gender with sexuality. Like heterosexuals, our sexuality or sexual orientation is part of our personal life none of which should define us,” said Joshi.LGBTQ community should also start wearing their sexuality on sleeves and shed inhibitions of being different, he added.Transgender activist Vidya Kamble, former major and HIV specialist Dr Milind Bhrushundi, MLA Dr Milind Mane and social activist Girish Gandhi participated in the discussion.Talking about transgenders’ rights, Kamble said, “Today, we are struggling for facilities as basic as a public toilet. We don’t have basic identification documents and it becomes the basis of rejection on professional front. The SC has passed the judgment but the ground reality is different. The government should extend benefits and include us in education schemes,” she said.“We have a population of 750 transgenders in the city and proper education and a little support from the society will help us earn daily bread,” she added.Dr Bhrushundi spoke about issues a homosexual faces while growing up and the positive effect of the judgment in curbing HIV. “A person growing up with different sexual orientation is not just confused about himself but fears facing the society due to stigma. This makes it twice as difficult for him to accept himself and takes a toll on his mental health,” he said.He said, “HIV is mainly prevalent in two sections of the society — heterosexuals aged between 15-25 years and in LGBTQ community. Fortunately, it has now become easier for us to identify the affected persons and curb it disease. It is easier for homosexuals to accept their ailment,” said Bhrushundi."

Police said the woman was six months pregnant now.The 30-year-old man from a village near Palani in Dindigul district was booked for cheating the woman from a locality on Vayaloor road in Trichy by allegedly keeping his HIV infection under wraps while marrying her. The man, a coolie, had married the woman in February this year and the latter came to know about his disease in July.Police inspector Andal Eswari said that the woman observed that the man had been looking tired and taking medicines frequently. Feeling worried about her husband’s health condition, she took him to the hospital and made him undergo a medical check-up which revealed that he was infected with HIV. “He was infected with HIV for a year but he conveniently covered up the matter for marrying her. But the woman is six months pregnant,” the inspector told TOI.When the shocked woman confronted her husband about the suppression of his illness, she had to face the music. According to the complaint, she was tortured mentally and physically by her husband and his family members – three women and two men, all residents of Pappampatti. After allegedly being subjected to torture for the past two months, she preferred to lodge a complaint with the police on Thursday.A case was registered under various sections including cheating, causing cruelty to woman by husband and his relatives and criminal intimidation. The police also booked him and five of his family members for physically and mentally torturing the woman. Since the accused were residents of Palani, the police were yet to dig deeper into the matter and arrest them. Doctors said that the chances of the woman getting infected with AIDS from her husband through their sexual relationship were higher."

We have launched a hunt for the contractor who cut the hoarding frame. We are still probing the case and depending upon the outcome, more action will be taken.”Senior inspector M Mujawar of the Bund Garden police said, “Our investigation is focused on identifying the railway authorities, who gave the contract, those who were monitoring the work and those responsible for the security of people. We have sought documents from the railway authorities related to the contract and allied details, and will examine the same.”Mujawar further said, “The railway authorities had given the contract to remove the hoarding frame to a private contractor, who is at large with his employees. Our team visited the residences of the contractor and his employees, but they were not there at home.”On the probe related to how the accident occurred, Mujawar said, “The frame came crashing down on the autorickshaws and other vehicles on the road with a huge force. The contractor’s employees had started dismantling the metal frame directly from the bottom instead of removing the upper parts of the structure first. They tied a rope to the metal frame and tried to pull it down towards the railway land. But something went wrong, and the frame swung towards the opposite direction and fell on the road with a catapult effect.”The railway authorities did not follow the due diligence, Mujawar said. “They could have halted the vehicular movement on the road for a few minutes while removing the structure or executed the task in the night.”CP meets civic chiefPune police commissioner K Venkatesham and Pune municipal Corporation (PMC) chief Saurabh Rao had a meeting on Saturday on illegal hoardings in the city. “I assured my full support to the civic admininstation in its drive against illegal hoardings.

Audacity of crime caught Delhi Police totally by surprise,2018-10-13,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Delhi News,Crime","NEW DELHI: Friday's bank robbery is not good news for Delhi Police . For at least a decade, none had dared target a bank in this manner.The cops are apprehensive that the successful day-time heist may have removed the fear of potential robbers of being nabbed on the bank premises by the customers and employees or of being surrounded by police alerted via secret alarms.The cops were able to recall only two bank-related crimes in the past few years, both burglaries carried out in at night. In the first incident in August last year, three thieves managed to sneak into Syndicate Bank in Mukherjee Nagar through the window.Taking advantage of the weekend closure, the men managed to hack the window grilles to enter the building. They made away with Rs 2.3 lakh worth of coins in 46 polythene bags.The cops, however, did not have to pursue the intruders for long and nabbed them within 48 hours.In the second incident on December 22, 2017, the three men involved dug a tunnel to the Cooperative Bank in outer Delhi's Mundka from a vacant adjacent plot. Armed with gas cutters and cylinders, they drilled a hole in the wall, entered the building one by one and disabled the CCTV cameras and the security alarm.The trio took away the CCTV footage recorders along with around Rs 30 lakh in cash and some jewellery having broken into at least 15 lockers. The cops arrested the three men after a month of investigation.Rather than break-ins of this sort, robbing of cash vans has been more common in the city these last five years or so.The criminals take advantage of the fact that cash companies often ferry large amounts of money to and from banks without providing police with prior information. In April this year, for instance, robbers shot dead two and fled with Rs 12 lakh from a cash van. Some incidents have involved the employees of the cash replenishment firms. They were caught stealing cash while refilling ATMs.However, an armed robbery was an unheard of for a lengthy period. For a city that is under constant terror threat, Friday's incident can set a precedent and encourage criminals and terrorists to execute similar capers to fund their gang and illegal activities.The Delhi Police brass has asked joint commissioners and deputy commissioners to take steps in this regard and conduct meetings with bank officials to sensitise them about the security measures that need to be taken to avert robberies."

"A blue pill is stopping HIV like never before, study shows",2018-10-19,SYDNEY,News,"SYDNEY: An antiviral pill taken daily by thousands of men across Sydney and other parts of Australia led to a globally unprecedented reduction in new HIV cases, showing that a targeted, preventative approach may accelerate progress on ending the AIDS epidemic.New cases of HIV among gay and bisexual men fell by almost a third to the lowest on record, according to the world’s first study to measure the impact of Gilead Sciences Inc's Truvada pill on reducing the AIDS-causing virus in a large population. The results, published Thursday in the Lancet HIV medical journal, may pave the way for other states and countries to stop transmission of the virus with the use of a treatment called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.""The speed of the decline we’ve seen in new HIV infections in gay and bisexual men is a world first,"" said study leader Andrew Grulich, head of HIV epidemiology and prevention at the Kirby Institute of the University of New South Wales. ""These numbers are the lowest on record since HIV surveillance began in 1985.""Progress against AIDS over the past 15 years has inspired a commitment by UN member states to end the epidemic by 2030. The number of people newly infected with HIV fell to 1.8 million worldwide in 2017, from more than 3 million a year through most of the 1990s. While the study results can’t be generalized to indicate similar efficacy in heterosexual populations, they do demonstrate that PrEP is ""highly cost-effective"" in certain high-risk groups, Grulich said in a phone interview.New HIV infections occurred in 102 gay and bisexual men in the state of New South Wales in the first year after the study began, compared with 149 infections in the 12 months prior.""While we’ve known for at least three or four years now of individual-level efficacy of PrEP, there has been some reticence around the world by policy makers to properly fund the roll out of PrEP because the population impact hasn’t been shown -- and that’s what we set out to do,"" Grulich said.There were about 180,000 people in the US taking Truvada for PrEP at the end of June, Robin L. Washington, Gilead’s chief financial officer, said on a conference call in July.The blue, oval-shaped pill is a fixed-dose combination of the drugs tenofovir, disoproxil and emtricitabine. Generic versions of Truvada made by Mylan NV, Cipla Ltd. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. have made the medication available more cheaply.""We see the nice steady growth of Truvada for the use of PrEP,"" Gilead’s Chief Executive Officer John F. Milligan told the Morgan Stanley Global Health Care Conference last month. Areas of the US with the highest uptake of PrEP had achieved some of the best reductions in HIV infections, he said.""I’m more confident now that the policymakers are being very innovative in thinking about how to increase access to PrEP,"" Milligan said. ""So we’ll be working on a number of things in the coming year that could really increase the number of patients on PrEP and could be very good for preventing the infection, and of course good for our business as well."""
Rehana Fathima is no pilgrim,2018-10-20,By,"News,City News,Kochi News","By: J Devika Ever since chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared CPM’s commitment to Kerala’s unique legacy of enlightened Hinduism on the Sabarimala issue, I have been wondering about the relative absence of CPM’s mass organization of women, whose membership runs into lakhs. I have firsthand knowledge that very many of its members are devout Hindus. If CPM were serious about drawing upon this legacy, I wondered, why is it that they are not making an active effort to encourage these women (and devout men in their other mass organizations) to embrace the Supreme Court’s valiant effort to ensure gender equality in the Hindu faith?Why is it not actively campaigning within its fold that undertaking the Sabarimala pilgrimage at this crucial moment in history is a key gesture of self-respect for female devotees? If CPM would have done that, we would not have been subject to this extremely painful sight of women trying to make it to the shrine, only to be violently ejected by criminals, hooligans and frenzied women, all emboldened by the brazen takeover of public space there by Hindutva elements. Definitely, CPM could have made sure that believers in their fold, male and female, made it to the shrine safe and sound. If so, stray ‘activists’ need not have risked their lives.I do not know if Rehana Fathima, a young woman who has often cocked a snook at conservative gender/sexual norms, who attempted the pilgrimage on Friday, was deliberately set up by Hindutva elements to create the impression that the shrine was in the danger of being sullied by ‘bad/women’ who are also non-Hindu. I don’t know if minister Kadakampally Surendran’s intervention was really to avert violence. Even if his intervention was really to that end, his indignant pronouncement that Sabarimala was not a playground for ‘activists’ did irreversible harm. In itself, there is nothing wrong with Rehana’s action: the Supreme Court permits women’s entry now and tradition does not bar people of other faiths from visiting the shrine.There are no standards established to measure the intensity of belief; even if they do exist, they are not applied to potential male pilgrims. It may indeed be the case that there were good reasons for the minister to stop Rehana. My point is, however, about the discourse he couches it in, which turns it into an affront against ‘believers’. This is not mitigated by his shrewd choice of words – ‘activist’, instead of ‘Muslim-born’, or ‘wayward woman’. One is even persuaded to think that CPM and BJP have arrived at a resolution of this chicken-game-like situation in which neither party can turn back without suffering loss of face.The resolution involves setting up an ‘other’ around which ‘true believers’ may consolidate themselves, the constituency of BJP, but one which CPM would like to woo too. Kadakampally’s offended tone directed at the ‘activist’ would help CPM do exactly this as it conveys a commitment to the purity of the shrine, even as it continues to encourage the ‘believing’/ ‘good’ woman!The stance adopted by CPM supporters – that they do not ask any woman to visit the shrine, only ensure a safe pilgrimage for any woman who chooses to go – creates the impression that there are no believers among them and therefore the toil of democratizing the Hindu community does not fall on them. This allows them to keep their mainstream Hindu base more or less invisible, exempt themselves from the burden of shaping new believers from within, and at the same time, keep up the appearance of neutrality in matters of religious faith. Nevertheless, they do want to gain from the social momentum unleashed by the Supreme Court judgment. Hence the goodcop bad-cop game: Pinarayi thunders about the legacy of Kerala’s social democratization in general (or Kodiyeri Balakrishnan defends ‘activists’); Kadakampally reacts in harsh tones against the specific instance of a ‘women’s activist’ trying to make hay while the sun shines. Kadakampally keeps his liberal-Hindu image, of one who supports ‘true women of the faith’ and simultaneously signals his commitment to the ‘purity of Sabarimala.’ The scapegoat in this sordid game is the ‘activist’ woman, a figure feared by both Hindutva right wing and Left-wing mainstream.There can be little doubt that these ‘activist’ women have caused these authorities the greatest worry in recent years. From sex workers to nuns, teagarden labourers to glamorous film stars, from the delicate-looking but steelwilled Hadiya to fearless young dalit women students, they have repeatedly, persistently, challenged the mainstream consensus on gender justice and social order – despite, mind you, the combined might of the police, the lower judiciary, caste leaders, community authorities, school principals, tearful parents, armies of hostile relatives, sexual offenders in offices, foul-mouthed male hordes online. Maybe history will treat Kadakampally’s reference as a compliment, albeit oblique.The writer is a scholar and author."
HIV positive cases decline in Vizianagaram: Govt data,2018-11-06,VIZIANAGARAM,"News,City News,Visakhapatnam News","VIZIANAGARAM: There has been a decline in the number of people being affected by human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) virus in Vizianagaram district , according to government data.Data for the last 10 years, since Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) Centres were opened in Vizianagaram and Parvathipuram divisions clearly indicate the declining trend, while the number of people being screened and tested has gone up three times approximately in the same time period (over the last decade).Talking to TOI, the Vizianagaram AIDS and Leprosy control officer, S Ravi Kumar, pointed out that the number of people testing HIV positive has come down both numerically and percentage wise.“We attribute this decrease chiefly to the rise in awareness over the last decade after ART centres were established. A massive public awareness campaign was conducted across the district and target groups were identified,” Kumar said.Referring to the data, Kumar said, “In 2008, when we began screening and testing people for HIV, out of the 22,672 tested, 1,771, turned to be HIV positive. Nine years later, for the year 2017, a total 73,360 were tested and only 633 turned out to be positive. The percentage of people, who tested positive in 2007 was 7.61% against 0.80% for 2017-2018.”Referring to HIV in pregnant women, AIDS control officials noted that 176 out of 29, 562 tested positive for the year 2008-2009, while only 29 out of the 60,686 tested positive last year, bringing the percentage count from close to 1% to less than 0.05%.The officials observed that this downward trend was continuing this year as well. Regarding the provision of treatment to affected people at the ART centres, the officials observed that earlier tablets were dispensed every month, but because of logistical issues, some of the affected were unable to turn up on time. They said that a special multi-dispensation programme was initiated by the National AIDS Control Society and training for the multi-dispensation programme was initiated for the staff members of the two ART centres in the district on Saturday, under the guidance of the DCHS (district community health services) officials."

10.42 lakh kids to get measles-rubella vaccination from November 27,2018-11-07,NAGPUR,"News,City News,Nagpur News","NAGPUR: Around 10,42,784 children under the age group of nine months to 15 years from the district will be administered measles-rubella (MR) vaccine between November 27 and January 18. The drive is part of the central government’s campaign to free India from these two viral diseases by 2020.Target is to cover 5,68,126 children from the city and 4,74,658 from rural parts of the district. The drive will be undertaken across the state during the same period.Officiating municipal commissioner Ravindra Thakre and additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi have urged the citizens and educational institutions to ensure vaccination to all children. World Health Organization (WHO) surveillance medical officer Dr Mohammed Sajid, in a press conference, said no major complications among the children were found during vaccination in 23 states. “Over 10.8 crore children in 23 states have been administered the vaccine since February 2017. Maharashtra is 24th state to be covered under the drive. It is undertaken as 49,200 people die due to measles every year. It is 40% of total deaths across the world. Around 50,000 people get infected with rubella every year in India,” he said.Sajid added vaccination in the district will be done in three rounds. “First, vaccination will be undertaken at schools. It will be carried out on one day in each school. List of children absent on the day will be taken from the school. Anganwadis will be covered under the second round. Transit camps will be organized to give vaccine to absentees and also people residing in high risk areas, roadsides etc. It will be facilitated in all government hospitals during the entire drive period,” he said.Sajid also said students above 15 years age and studying in Std X will also be given the vaccine. “No death has been registered during the drive in 23 states. One in 1,000 children suffered very mild fever . Other types of complications like swelling in the area where vaccine was administered etc are also rare,” he said.The WHO official said children who were administered MMR vaccine earlier will also be given MR vaccine. “Children who are severely ill, admitted or infected with HIV will not be covered under the drive,” he added.Each school, anganwadi or centres will have three rooms/compartments. Registration will be done in the first, vaccination in second and recreation followed by distribution of certificate in the third room. The drive will not be carried out door-to-door.Sajid said one doctor will be appointed for three schools/centres. “Nurses (ANM) will administer the injectable vaccine. Auto disable syringe will be used for the drive to ensure no reuse of it takes place,” he said.In the city, NMC in association with WHO, Unicef, IMA and 15 different departments will conduct the drive.Additional municipal commissioner Aziz Sheikh, deputy municipal commissioner Rajesh Mohite, medical officers Dr Sunil Ghurde, Dr Vijay Joshi and others were present at the press meet."
Maharashtra: H1N1 stings 41-60 age group with 201 fatalities,2018-11-12,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News,Civic Issues News","MUMBAI: Nearly two out of three H1N1 influenza virus victims this year from the state were perfectly healthy with no history of any underlying chronic disease. A departure from previous years, where a majority of deaths and complications were seen in ailing and elderly people with compromised immune systems, the worrying trend of the healthy falling prey has experts scurrying for answers.While H1N1, often known as swine flu, does claim lives of some healthy people every year, that percentage is much less compared to those suffering from diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, among other common conditions. This year, this high-risk group accounted for only 39% (146) of 376 deaths as opposed to 230 deaths in people with no disease history. Among comorbid conditions, people with diabetes and hypertension were most susceptible as 109 of 146 had either of the conditions or both. Nine had hypothyroidism, while a handful was co-infected with dengue, HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis.The rising instances of H1N1 influenza virus victims with no history of any chronic disease is a new headache for health officials. ""It's a matter of concern and we are trying to understand why it has happened,"" said Dr Pradeep Awate, Maharashtra's epidemiologist, suggesting that it was a rare trend.""We have also looked into whether the virus has undergone any change, but experts at the National Institute of Virology in Pune have noticed nothing unusual so far,"" he said, adding that discussions are revolving around the body's immune response.Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava concurred that some of the answers perhaps lie there. He explained that when a virus attacks an individual, there are two-three explanations why one might succumb rapidly.""First and most talked about is the cytokine storm , which refers to a state where the body's own immune response to the attack is overwhelming so much so that it can damage organs, particularly the lungs and kidneys, and even lead to death,"" he said. He added that in several deaths as well as cases this season, the involvement of kidney was little more than usual.Besides cytokine storm, Dr Srivastava said that co-infection with another pathogen could complicate matters even for healthy individuals. ""Combined with that if there is a delay in seeking care, it could deal a serious blow,"" he said. A delay in seeking care and receiving the right antiviral was also found to be responsible for several complications and deaths this season.An age-wise analysis of the deaths showed that maximum casualties (201) were between 41-60 years. ""Even in the past we have seen deaths in this group, which is working and therefore mobile,"" said Dr Awate. Next was the age bracket of 26 to 40 that witnessed 84 deaths. Unlike the west where the majority of deaths are seen in the 60-plus bracket, here around 16% deaths were in senior citizens.Did vaccination play a role in protecting the elderly or not doing the same for healthy individuals who most likely were not vaccinated. Numbers suggest a little over 1.28lakh people were vaccinated against H1N1. ""At any given point only around 10% of our population is immunized, including pregnant women. We are anyway not covering the entire risk population, so lack of vaccination seems to be an unlikely cause,"" he added. Among the deceased were also 13 pregnant women, the state data showed.Gender didn't seem to be a factor in the influenza activity as the ratio of male-female casualties were almost the same. However, intriguingly, 81% of the deaths were seen in private hospitals, raising questions about timely detection and treatment."
"Coordinators for organ retrieval units at Government Medical College, Mayo soon",2018-11-10,NAGPUR,"News,City News,Nagpur News","NAGPUR: The organ retrieval units at Government Medical College, and Mayo Hospital have witnessed only one successful transplant each until now. The procedure for organ retrieval has been marred with many challenges. To overcome them, two individuals from Nagpur will be placed as medical coordinators in both hospitals, and are expected to start duties from the first week of December.These appointments are part of a pilot project launched by Tata Trusts, Mohan Foundation, and the zonal committee to strengthen organ transplantation in government hospitals.Apart from GMC and Mayo Hospital in Nagpur, GMC Aurangabad, BJMC Pune, and VNGMC Solapur are also part of the project. An MoU in this regard was signed over a month ago between Mohan Foundation, Tata Trusts, and the state government.Highlighting a recent study conducted on challenges in organ retrieval, which was reported by TOI in May, director of Mohan Foundation Dr Ravi Wankhede said there is a shortage of ventilators and dedicated staff to follow-up on brain-death cases. The report by Mohan Foundation and Tata Trusts was presented to minister of medical education Girish Mahajan.GMCH dean Dr Abhimanyu Niswade concedes that there is a paucity of ventilators in GMCH. “Our trauma centre has 23 ventilators and the hospital has a total of 87 ventilators. But we need at least 100 ventilators. Life of a ventilator is only two years. We need 30 new ventilators every year. But last year we received only five for the Trauma Centre,” he said.Some patients come from other states, which makes obtaining consent through counselling impossible, since the main stakeholders are absent, he adds.Mayo Hospital forensic department head Dr Makarand Vyawahare said, “Mayo has no MRI facility yet, so the patient has to be taken outside for the test. Apnoea test is also a mandatory examination for determining brain-death. After this, counselling of the relatives in required.”Talking about other challenges, Mayo anaesthesia head Dr Vaishali Shelgaonkar said, “In many cases of brain-death due to accidents, relatives are not aware of the incident. Until the police find the relatives, the organs of the patient start to deteriorate. Organs of a brain-dead patient can be maintained for maximum 72 hours through additional drugs.”Despite about seven ideal brain-dead cases at Mayo since it received organ retrieval permission in March, and full facilities in the hospital as per norms, organ retrieval has been done only in one case in July. Illiteracy among relatives and inadequate manpower for counselling and paperwork is another challenge, said Dr Shelgaonkar.Brain-dead patients with cancer, HIV , severe infection or above 60 years of age don’t qualify for organ retrieval. Homicidal and poisoning cases also don’t qualify as ideal cases for organ retrieval."

Health activists raise concerns over IP provisions at RCEP,2018-11-13,MUMBAI,"News,BUSINESS NEWS,India Business News","MUMBAI: Public health activists and patient groups have raised serious concerns over intellectual property (IP) provisions in the ongoing negotiations of regional comprehensive economic partnership (RCEP), charging Japan and South Korea of pushing a TRIPS-plus regime which would expand and extend monopolies for pharma MNCs, and undermine generic competition. This, in effect, would impact generic competition that is critical for lowering medicines prices, and hence keep them unaffordable for millions of patients across the developing world.By ""resisting pressure"" in the past, and safeguarding its generic industry, India —often referred as 'a pharmacy of the developing world,' has become a leading supplier of affordable generic medicines for HIV , TB, malaria and other infectious diseases, across the world.In a letter to Union commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu, activists say if the proposed provisions are accepted, it will be a major setback for public health safeguards under Indian patent laws. Japan and South Korea reportedly continue to push India and Asean member states to agree to IP provisions that expand and introduce new monopolies for pharmaceutical corporations, including data exclusivity, patent term extension and stringent IP enforcement.These provisions are referred to as TRIPS-plus, and go beyond India’s obligations under the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on trade related aspect of intellectual property rights (TRIPS), industry experts say.Patient groups have asked the government to protect the flexibilities available under TRIPS agreement in larger public interest, and reject ""harmful IP provisions that would undermine the right to health in India, and contribute to the ongoing crisis of spiralling medicine prices.""Negotiations for RCEP agreement have reached a crucial stage as member countries gather in Singapore this week to continue hammering out the multilateral deal. These concerns follow red flags raised earlier by key ministries (in India) including textiles, steel and electronics over the ongoing negotiations.Activists feel test data and patent should be removed from IP negotiations, and have sought rejection of harmful provisions including patent term extension (extending patent term beyond TRIPS-mandated 20 years); data exclusivity (granting additional monopolies by prohibiting the regulatory authority from relying on clinical trial data to grant market approval to lower-priced lifesaving medicines); IP enforcement measures, and investment chapter ( investor-state dispute settlement allows pharmaceutical corporations to sue governments like India for applying TRIPS flexibilities to safeguard public health).""It is important that India categorically reject all the above mentioned proposed provisions that go beyond TRIPS so as to ensure that the final RCEP trade agreement is in line with India’s public health commitments,"" the letter adds.Says Leena Menghaney head South Asia , MSF Access Campaign, ""People in countries that have signed trade agreements with damaging intellectual property provisions that seek to extend monopolies for pharmaceutical corporations are already experiencing the negative impacts in the form of high medicines prices, delayed availability of affordable generic medicines and a weakening of public health safeguards in their patent systems. Despite constant pressure, India has managed to resist the inclusion of these provisions.""More importantly, India is leading by example for other developing countries which have incorporated stricter patentability standards into their law."

Their only son is pursuing graduation in Chintamani.His wife told STOI they’re facing discrimination everywhere. “I approached the government hospital in Chintamani also, but considering his HIV status, they said as it’s a high-risk case he needed a separate machine for dialysis However, doctors claimed all patients who come to INU are initially treated here as it’s a peripheral centre. Later, they are advised to go back to their native places for further treatment as these facilities are available in all districts now.“It’s not a case of discrimination. I will look into the issue,” said institute director Dr Shivalingaiah. He said over 80 patients undergo dialysis every day and had to be taken to INU only. We went to INU last week, but the hospital is not treating him,” she alleged.She said from May to July, he was put on dialysis thrice a week. But it stopped since July.

India eyes 100% switch from disposable to reuse prevention syringes by 2020,2018-09-20,LUCKNOW,"News,India News","LUCKNOW: India has pledged to replace the currently prevalent disposable injections with reuse prevention (RUP) syringes by 2020.""Setting targets under the National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme, which was launched in July this year, the Indian health ministry had pledged to achieve 100% usage of engineered safety devices to curtail injection related infections,"" said Dr Chandrakant Lahariya , National Professional Officer, universal health coverage, WHO-India.He was in the city to speak at a workshop with Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences faculty and staff on safety-engineered syringes. Organised by SGPGI's gastroentrology department, which is also WHO Collaborating Centre for Viral Hepatitis, the workshop aimed at creating awareness on the issue of hepatitis.To note, RUP is a kind of safety engineered syringe which becomes redundant after one use. It is better than the prevalent disposable injections which can be re-used easily if not disposed correctly. Reuse of such syringes is associated with a number of diseases including hepatitis and HIV among others.""Use of unsafe syringes is a major risk factor for hepatitis B and C. The switch from so-called disposable syringes will help in bringing down prevalence of hepatitis B and C by 30-35%,"" added Dr Lahariya. This is crucial considering that about 1.34 crore Indians suffer with hepatitis-C infection while an equal number carry hepatitis B.Unsafe use of injections is associated with a number of other diseases ranging from simple absys to HIV. In 2002-03, Indian government got a survey on usage of injections done. The only survey of its kind revealed that two-third of the syringes being used in India was unsafe. Experts believe that proportion of unsafe injections could have come down following adoption of auto-disable syringes in the national routine immunisation programme.But the extent of the problem still remains big as (according to 2002 study) average usage of syringes per person per year in India is 2.9. This translates into use of 350 - 400 crore injections in the country. ""The disease burden of problems like hepatitis and HIV stand self-explained considering that 50-65% of the injections are unsafe,"" said Dr Amit Goel, associated professor, gastroentrology, SGPGI.Senior faculty, gastroentrology, SGPGI, Prof Rakesh Aggarwal stated that in wake of these current scenario, investment in prevention of viral hepatitis by promotion of safety engineered syringes is public interest. ""Investment in prevention of a disease is always much lower than the amount that goes in treatment and rehabilitation,"" he said.NHM UP misses crucial policy eventBesides causing viral hepatitis, use of unsafe syringes was associated with transmission of HIV. As per WHO, 33,877 persons contracted HIV because of unsafe injections across the world every year. In February last, indiscriminate use of a single injection in many persons by a quack in Unnao was associated with diagnosis of HIV positive in 45 persons in a village. But while Punjab has already adopted RUP syringes, UP is yet to start. On Thursday in fact, officials from UP's National Health Mission skipped the crucial policy orientation event. ""As for now, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh are the only Indian states to have begun the process of discarding the disposable syringes. But other states, particularly Uttar Pradesh join, India cannot achieve the target,"" he said."
"Tiny, portable device can quickly detect cancer",2018-09-22,NEW YORK,News,"NEW YORK: Scientists have developed cancer detector – about half the size of a lunch box – that can be used to quickly and accurately diagnose the disease in remote parts of the world.Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a cancer that develops in lymph or blood vessels, and usually appears as lesions on the skin, inside of the mouth or internally.There are four types of the disease; epidemic, or AIDS-associated, KS is the most common in sub-Saharan Africa and is AIDS-defining. That means when someone with the HIV virus is diagnosed with KS, they officially have AIDS.Early detection leads to better outcomes, but that's not always possible in the developing world, where pathological testing can take one to two weeks.TINY performs loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for nucleic acid quantification. That requires heating the sample to 154 degrees, which necessitates a power source.One of the main benefits of TINY is that it can collect and store heat generated from electricity, the sun or even a Bunsen burner, and will function even during temporary power disruption, of which three occurred during testing in Uganda TINY's power flexibility is important because in many sub-Saharan African countries healthcare facilities lack access to reliable electricity.For the study, researchers collected biopsy samples from 71 patients in Uganda suspected of having KS and tested the samples with TINY as well as via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), the current standard for nucleic acid quantification.Agreement between TINY and qPCR was 94 per cent (67 of 71), and the team showed that all disagreement stemmed from assay limitations and not TINY capability.Not only can TINY be carried to remote locations for point-of-care use, it could also be valuable in clinics and hospitals where electric power can be unreliable."

An increase of 2.2 litres is expected in India alone which represents a large proportion of the total population in this region, the report highlighted.However, increases, although smaller, are also expected in Indonesia and Thailand (with the second- and fourth-largest largest populations).The second-highest increase is projected for the populations of the Western Pacific Region, where the population of China is the largest, with an increase in per capita consumption of 0.9 litres of pure alcohol by 2025.Total alcohol per capita consumption has increased globally after a relatively stable phase between 2000 and 2005. Since then, total per capita consumption rose from 5.5 litres in 2005 to 6.4 litres in 2010 and was still at the level of 6.4 litres in 2016, the report stated.However, diverging trends were noticed in different regions of the world.The harmful use of alcohol is one of the leading risk factors for population health worldwide and has a direct impact on many health-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including those for maternal and child health, infectious diseases (HIV, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis), noncommunicable diseases and mental health, injuries and poisonings.In 2016, the harmful use of alcohol resulted in some 3 million deaths (5.3 per cent of all deaths) worldwide and 132.6 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Mortality resulting from alcohol consumption is higher than that caused by diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and diabetes.Among men in 2016, an estimated 2.3 million deaths and 106.5 million DALYs were attributable to the consumption of alcohol. 0.7 million women died and they experienced 26.1 million DALYs attributable to alcohol consumption.The harmful use of alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 diseases and injury conditions, the report stated.Some 2.3 billion people are current drinkers. Globally more than a quarter (26.5 per cent) of all 15–19 year-olds are current drinkers, amounting to 155 million adolescents.The WHO has emphasized on the development, implementation and evaluation of cost-effective interventions for harmful use of alcohol as well as creating, compiling and disseminating scientific information on alcohol use and dependence, and related health and social consequences.The ""Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol"", negotiated and agreed by WHO Member States in 2010, represents international consensus that reducing the harmful use of alcohol and its associated health and social burden is a public health priority.The strategy provides guidance for action at all levels, including 10 recommended target areas for policy options and interventions for national action to reduce the harmful use of alcohol and the main components for global action to support and complement activities at country level."

"Anti-Trafficking Bill receives mixed response from voluntary organisations, civil society & activists",2018-07-27,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Thursday put its stamp of approval on the ‘Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2018.Introduced as “victim-centric” and “the first step towards a comprehensive solution to trafficking of Persons in India”, the Bill has received a mixed response from voluntary organisations, civil society activists and lawyers. The responses range from assertive support to strong criticism.“This bill is not intended to harass those sex workers who are voluntarily in the profession... This is a bill that has a compassionate view of people who have been victims of sex racket,” Women and Child Development minister Maneka Gandhi told the Lok Sabha. Recent protests and concerns raised by certain voluntary organisations include the worry that some provisions of the Bill can be misused once it becomes a law for victimising sex workers.After Gandhi replied to the various queries by MPs and the Bill was passed in Lok Sabha, Nobel peace laureate Kailash Satyarthi who has for decades worked on the issue of trafficking and child rights welcomed the passage of the Bill saying: Trafficking of innocent children, women and men is the biggest threat against humanity. The Indian Parliament has taken a strong first step to end this menace by passing anti trafficking bill 2018 in Lok Sabha.”Satyarthi went on to say that “it is a progressive legislation that seeks to provide for a comprehensive solution to trafficking of persons in India, that goes beyond its criminalisation. I call upon Rajya Sabha MPs to echo the same sentiment & extend their support for this landmark bill”.During her response to the queries by MPs, Gandhi shared that Kailash Satyarthi was one of those who was consulted when the Bill was drafted. She also mentioned the names of NGO Prayas and renowned activist Sunitha Krishnan , chief functionary of voluntary organisation Prajwala.President of Shakti Vahini and one of the members of the drafting committee of the Bill, Ravikant also welcomed the passage of the Bill and was dismissive of the apprehensions of those opposing it. He said it will be a law with many firsts and will finally bring into focus the victim protection and rehabilitation. He pointed that this Act is a big step in the journey since 2011 when India ratified the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC) and its three protocols. One of the protocols is a commitment to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children.Amod Kanth from NGO said, “We look forward to get the best out of this long awaited Bill once it comes on the statute nook.” He also took on those opposing the Bill saying, “Spoke to Maneka Gandhi on behalf of Prayas and all our NGO partners who stood by her while she fought a tough battle against the narrow – visioned motivated groups.”Meanwhile, Trade Union Initiative, HAQ Centre for Child Rights, Lawyers Collective , National Network of Sex Workers, All India Network of Sex Workers are among other civil society organisations that came together to object to the passage of the Bill citing gaps that they feel need to be plugged before a law is passed.They point that the Bill is replete with problems. “Many of these problems were alluded to by Members of Parliament, who demanded that the Bill be referred to a Standing Committee in Parliament,” a statement issued by this collective of NGOs and activists reads.In a statement released a day before the monsoon session of parliament started, they warned that certain provisions can be a potential threat to “civil liberties and freedom of expression."" They claimed that the Bill criminalises electronic communication that “may lead to” trafficking. “There is no need for trafficking to have actually taken place. A mere possibility of someone getting trafficked sometime in the future is sufficient for the Police to arrest and prosecute,” they pointed.In the statement, they pointed that “contrary to claims, the Bill targets sex workers” even though on the face of it the Bill appears to have no impact on sex workers due to absence of words like “prostitution” and “sexual exploitation and abuse for a commercial purpose.” “Yet, the Bill will rely on existing Section 370 to criminalise trafficking for “any form of sexual exploitation” and be enforced in sex work settings,” it is claimed by activists.They point that ‘aggravated forms of trafficking’ under the Bill include exposure to HIV and trafficking resulting in pregnancy. This, they say, indirectly targets sex workers. “Moreover, the Bill does not repeal Immoral Traffic Prevention Act. So, sex workers will continue to be arrested and jailed,” they have stated.It was also stated that the Bill may add to bureaucratic red-tape and lack of accountability as it may lead to multiplicity of authorities looking into similar cases. For instance, the Child Welfare Committees deal with all cases related to children in need of care and protection including survivors of trafficking. However, to a question in Lok Sabha, the WCD minister was quick to reject the view that new authorities were being created. She said that only the National Anti Trafficking Bureau will be the new thing.Meanwhile, this collective of civil society groups, after the passage of the Bill in Lok Sabha, in a statement quoted the UN Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in persons, especially women and children and the special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences. They say that the UN special rapporteurs have expressed grave concerns saying that “its (Bill’s) focus on addressing trafficking from a criminal law perspective is not sufficiently complemented by a human-rights based and victim-centred approach, and this risks further harming already vulnerable individuals.”They then go on to hit out at those from the voluntary sector supporting the Bill in its current form saying, “We are aware that a section of NGOs and influential persons have been lobbying hard for the hurried passage of the Bill. Many of these groups were involved in drafting the Bill, which was otherwise a closed and opaque process.”They urged the members of the Rajya Sabha for insights and resilience to ensure that the Bill is examined and evaluated and not hastily passed into law.· “Aggravated forms of trafficking” for forced labour, child bearing, begging and marriage to be punished severely.· Punishment for such crimes will not be less than 10 years imprisonment and may extend to life in jail.· Repeat offenders will face jail for the rest of their life and a minimum fine of Rs 2 lakh.· Administration of hormones for early sexual maturity, exposing a person to life threatening illness like HIV and abetting a person to illegally migrate is as “aggravated trafficking offences”.· Provides for attachment and confiscation of illicit assets created out of trafficking crimes.· Imposes heavy fines and freezing of bank accounts of perpetrators.· Bill lays down provisions for confidentiality of victims, witnesses and complainants, time-bound trials and repatriation of the victims.· “National Anti-Trafficking Bureau” — under MHA"

hepatitis patients: ‘Hepatitis patients more at risk of liver cancer’,2018-07-29,HYDERABAD,,"HYDERABAD: With ‘Test. Treat. Cure’ the theme of World Hepatitis Day this year, doctors point to the importance of spreading awareness about this largely ‘overlooked’ disease and the need for vulnerable groups such as pregnant mothers and those who have undergone blood transfusions to get tested early and regularly.“Viral Hepatitis is a cause for major healthcare burden in India and is now equated as a threat comparable to the “big three” communicable diseases -- HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Hepatitis A and Hepatitis E viruses are predominantly enterically transmitted pathogens that are responsible for both sporadic infections and epidemics of acute viral Hepatitis. Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C are predominantly spread via the parenteral route and are notorious for causing chronic Hepatitis, which can lead to grave complications including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Around 400 million people world suffer from chronic Hepatitis globally,” said Dr Dharmesh Kapoor, senior hepatologist at a city hospital. If a person is at risk of contracting the disease, they must get tested early on and regularly, said doctors.“By the time any of the symptoms manifest, it is usually too late . Those who have Hepatitis are at great risk of liver cancer and liver disease. Babies can be saved from the infection if they are given the vaccine right after birth.”said Dr Bhavani Rajum, gastroenterologist at a city hospital."

"‘Tolerance limits’ to be fixed by food regulator for presence of antibiotics in animal, foods",2018-08-01,NEW DELHI,,"NEW DELHI: Worried about consuming antibiotics through eggs, meat or milk? You may breathe a sigh of relief. The food regulator has decided to curb use of antibiotics and veterinary drugs to ensure safety of animal products such as processed meat, meat products, poultry and eggs, sea foods and milk.The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) will soon fix ""tolerance limits"" for presence of antibiotics in such food items. FSSAI has made changes to the existing Food Safety and Standards (Contaminants, toxins and Residues) Regulations, 2011. The amendments are likely to be notified by end of this week, official sources said.The proposed regulations will also require vets and animal owners to ensure that any animal products they produce are drug-free before they can be used as food. The new regulations would also mean enforcement of drug withdrawal period before treated animals, eggs or milk are used for consumption as food. This allows time for the drugs to completely leave the animal’s system, an official said.Once the new regulation is in place, FSSAI will do surprise inspections and random sampling to check all such products available in the market do not contain antibiotic residues beyond the permissible limit.The move comes in the wake of concerns related to presence of antibiotics in such animal foods. While India has been under severe international pressure, overuse of antibiotics in food-producing animals is often blamed for the increase in super bugs.“Antibiotic resistance is a serious problem and animal products are a major source of it. We want to ensure that no contaminated food products are able to enter the food supply,” FSSAI chief executive Pawan Kumar Agarwal told TOI.Antibiotics are given to farm animals like cows, pigs and poultry for primarily two reasons – either to treat infections and prevent an illness from spreading or to promote their extra growth. Low doses of antibiotics are mixed with fodder for greater production of meat or milk in a shorter period of time. These low doses may also reduce death rates and improve reproduction.While resistant bacteria can be passed from food-producing animals to humans, anti-microbial resistance threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infectious diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, urinary tract infection (UTI) and even HIV.The government has already initiated several measures to contain misuse of antibiotics in humans. For instance, the campaign — ‘Medicines with the Red Line’— which involves packs of certain medicines carrying a ‘red line’ to differentiate them from other drugs and discouraging unnecessary prescription.Still many antibiotics including some unapproved ones are regularly sold over the counter in India. India is one of the five BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) that accounted for three quarters of the 36% rise in worldwide antibiotic consumption between 2000 and 2010, according to a 2016 study. That study also found that in the BRICS countries 23% of the increase in retail sales volume of antibiotics was attributable to India."

"GRH in damage control mode, denies charges of blood wastage",2018-08-03,MADURAI,"News,City News,Madurai News","MADURAI: Rejecting charges of blood wastage at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), officials of the hospital said that it was done with a mala fide intent.Speaking to reporters, medical officer of the Madurai Blood Bank, GRH, Dr Cyntha Thirumalai and dean Dr D Marudhu Pandian said the blood bank was efficiently utilising most of the blood donated and stored here. The wastage was minimized to less than 0.6% of the total storage capacity though the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) norms and could be up to 5%.They said that reports of the blood bank carelessly discarding the precious donated blood, as reported in some media was false. “It was done with a mala fide intent by a councillor attached to the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (Tansacs) along with a worker of a private agency in the hospital. The hospital has recommended that both be terminated from their respective places of work at the earliest. Only 136 out of the 25,000 units received by the blood bank annually are discarded,” Cyntha said, which was less than 0.6%.Cyntha added that both the Tansacs councillor Angeline Nandhi and Muniasamy, a worker of Padmavathi Hospitality and Facilities Management Service had confessed to the crime, of discarding treated, but waste blood from a bag into an open place to help a media person photograph the same. “Such actions would only discourage donors who come to donate blood which is a noble cause, saving the lives of nearly 60,000 patients annually,” she said.The blood bank of the GRH receives about 25,000 units of blood every year, which is separated into its components and donated as per the requirement of the patient. NACO’s guidelines are strictly adhered to at the hospital and proper screening is done before the blood is stored. Waste is generated only when the blood samples test positive for transfusion transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS, or get damaged during the storage process, as the blood is rotated at the rate of 3,500 rotations per minute to separate its components.Blood samples taken for screening are also discarded as waste after the tests are conducted.

Mixed response to anti-trafficking bill,2018-08-03,THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,"News,City News,Thiruvananthapuram News,Politics","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The anti-trafficking bill (2018), which was passed by Lok Sabha, has triggered a debate in state. Some raised objections against its provisions saying that it was not survivor-centric, while others claimed that it was quite comprehensive.“The bill creates a new offence known as ‘aggravated trafficking’, which attracts 10 years in prison that may extend to life imprisonment. This is in addition to the existing definition of trafficking under IPC Section 370. However, the logical fallacy of this gradation is evident when it lists trafficking (for begging) as an ‘aggravated offence’, whereas trafficking for sexual exploitation is a general offence. We need a legislation that harmonizes various provisions to end trafficking,” said MP Shashi Tharoor He added Centre had promised a comprehensive legislation before the Supreme Court in 2015 in the Prajwala case. “The bill only adds to the existing, overlapping cocktail of laws. Through the creation of 10 antitrafficking bodies, it will create more confusion in enforcing laws,” said the MP.He added that Clause 16 of the bill – which allows medical examination of survivors – fails to mention that consent of survivors will be taken as and when practicable. This is relevant as there might be people with HIV/ AIDS among survivors and there have been instances where their medical results have been shared with courts without consent. Courts have unfortunately ruled that such persons must remain in rehab homes as their families are unable to take care of them, he said.Activist Sunitha Krishnan – who took efforts to create the bill’s initial draft – said: “Of the 14 chapters in the bill, six focuses on survivors – including their rescue, protection, compensation, relief and rehab. It is the most survivor-centric and gender-neutral bill focused on ending trafficking,” she said.Former member of Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights advocate J Sandhya said the bill seeks multiple level systems (national, state, district and local) to prevent trafficking. If more committees are involved, it would be less effective in checking crime. “On the compensation fund, it seems to be creating another parallel programme. No funds are offered in the existing compensation fund. Sexual violence and protection of survivors must be handled in totality,” she said.Tharoor added that a sum of Rs 10 crore will be allotted by the Centre to the rehab fund whereas the present central government has spent Rs 4,343 crore on publicity since May 2014. This is a bill drafted by the bureaucracy for the bureaucracy, he said."

Homosexual relationships do not lead to STDs like AIDS: SC,2018-07-17,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: The Victorian-era morality, prohibitions, unsafe sex and living in denial have led to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases like AIDS and it cannot be blamed on homosexual relationships, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said while observing the sexual intercourse itself should not be seen as a crime.The apex court termed the prohibitions on acts like prostitution and homosexual relationships as one of the causes for the spread of STDs and said, ""If you licence prostitution, you control it. If you shove it under the carpet, owing to some Victorian-era morality, it will only lead to health concerns"".A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra , which today reserved its verdict on pleas seeking decriminalisation of consensual gay sex, was not in agreement with the submissions of the lawyers favouring retention of section 377 in the IPC, that the homosexual relationships have led to spread of AIDS.""The cause of sexually transmitted diseases is not sexual intercourse. But unprotected sexual intercourse. A village woman may get the disease from a husband who is a migrant worker,"" the bench said.""This way you would want to make sexual intercourse itself a crime,"" the bench, also comprising also comprised Justices R F Nariman, A M Khanwilkar, D Y Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra, asked.If prostitution is licensed then all health parameters and concerns will be met, the court said adding that when it is made illegal then such health-related issues arise.Senior advocate K Radhakrishnan, appearing for NGO 'Trust God Ministries' and lawyer Shyam George, representing some Christian organisations, submitted that the homosexuals spread STDs like HIV and the huge public funds are being spent to combat it.""So heterosexuals do not transmit sexually transmitted diseases,"" the bench wondered.Public acceptance that people live in gay relationships will help meet health concerns and homosexuals who live in denial with no access to medical care are more in danger to contract or spread HIV,"" the bench said.At the outset, George said the courts should not add or delete words to the statute that is not expressly provided and it was the job of the legislature.""We would not wait for the majoritarian government to enact, amend or not to enact any law to deal with violations of fundamental rights,"" the bench said and made clear that it may strike down a law if fundamental rights are infringed.George said that the section 377 of the IPC does not consider the aspect of consent and it only deals with the unnatural sexual acts which is against the ""order of the nature"".He also said that the term sexual orientation cannot be read interchangeably with the term 'sex' used in Article 14 and 15 of the Constitution, which deal with the right to equality of the citizens as there were 32-50 types of sexual orientations.""Sexual orientation is of abstract nature and such an abstract concept cannot be read into Article 15 and moreover, the term sexual orientation has not been defined either in the Constitution or in any other statute,"" he said.The bench said its NALSA verdict recognised trans-gender as a gender besides male and female.It then questioned the authenticity of the materials provided by the lawyer in the issue of sexual orientation and said that there were several ""fake and hate"" websites and one should be careful in using such contents.It has been argued that the right to intimacy was as valid as the right to marriage, George said, adding that the European Human Rights court has held that ""the right to marry is not a conventional right"".""If such unnatural offence as under section 377 is allowed with consent then it would have cascading effect on many other legislations,"" he said.The provision could be read as holding bestiality as an unnatural offence and sexual act with persons under 18 years of age as an offence, the bench said.Senior lawyer K Radhakrishnan opposed the pleas seeking to set aside section 377 and said that what was criminalised was the unnatural act and the provision was gender neutral.The right to privacy cannot be allowed to be an ""unruly horse"" and the sexual organs are being abused by indulging in unnatural sexual acts which were not assigned by nature, he said.The court will have to examine the extent to which the right to privacy may be extended as the persons will need to uphold the public morality while enjoying the privacy rights, the lawyer said.Lawyer H P Sharma, appearing for an intervenor, opposed the plea saying that repealing the provision would adversely affect the institution of marriage.There is no law to save the marriage if a husband wants to indulge in homosexual acts, he said, adding that the problem of homosexuality would affect Army and students living in hostels.The court reserved its verdict after lawyers concluded their arguments in the case."
"'Trafficking bill can be threat to freedom of expression', say activists",2018-07-17,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: A day before the monsoon session of parliament civil society representatives, labour unions, sex workers, human rights groups and child rights activists came together to demand that the government should defer the introduction of the ‘Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2018’ in the Parliament. Citing many loopholes in the Bill, they also warned that certain provisions can be a potential threat to “civil liberties and freedom of expression.”This pertains to Section 39 (2) of the Bill which states “whoever solicits or publicises electronically, taking or distributing obscene photographs or videos or providing materials or soliciting or guiding tourists or using agents or any other form which may lead to the trafficking of a person shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years but may extend to ten years.” The accused will also be liable to a fine which shall not be less than Rs 1 lakh.Anand Grover, senior advocate, Lawyers Collective said, “the Bill criminalises a host of activities including electronic communication through websites, social media and what’s app which “may lead to” or are “likely to lead to”, trafficking. This is dangerous for civil liberties and the freedom of expression.” He pointed that the Supreme Court has struck down similarly vague provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000. “If this Bill is passed, it will meet with the same fate,” Grover added.In a statement released by the civil society groups, lawyers and activists point out that, “The Bill criminalises electronic communication that “may lead to” trafficking. There is no need for trafficking to have actually taken place. A mere possibility of someone getting trafficked sometime in the future is sufficient for the Police to arrest and prosecute.”They have also submitted their representation on the gaps in the Bill to Union minister Maneka Gandhi and shared their concerns on various issues. At a press conference on Tuesday, they made a public appeal to the WCD minister to defer the introduction of the Bill in its current form in the parliament. “If the government goes ahead and introduces the Bill, then we appeal to the parliamentarians to refer it to a parliamentary standing committee for scrutiny,” lawyer Tripti Tandon from Lawyers Collective added.In their statement, it is pointed that “contrary to claims, the Bill targets sex workers” even though on the face if it the Bill appears to have no impact on sex workers due to the absence of words like “prostitution” and “sexual exploitation and abuse for a commercial purpose.” “Yet, the Bill will rely on existing Section 370 to criminalise trafficking for “any form of sexual exploitation” and be enforced in sex work settings,” it is claimed by activists. They point out that ‘aggravated forms of trafficking’ under the Bill include exposure to HIV and trafficking resulting in pregnancy. This they say indirectly targets sex workers. “Moreover, the Bill does not repeal the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act. So, sex workers will continue to be arrested and jailed,” they have stated."
HBV: Tamil Nadu dialysis patients at high risk of contracting hepatitis: Study,2018-07-19,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Civic Issues","CHENNAI: All patients undergoing treatment at a dialysis unit in the state have tested positive for hepatitis and none of them was aware of their status, a recently-published study undertaken to find the prevalence of the infection in Tamil Nadu found. Of the 23 dialysis patients at the unit, four tested positive for hepatitis B, while 19 (82.6%) tested positive for the more severe hepatitis C infection, the study found.The study, published in the European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, concluded that prevalence of hepatitis B ( HBV ) in the general population was 1.63% and hepatitis C ( HCV ) was 0.30% in the general population a figure lesser than what the World Health Organisation’s estimate of 2% and 0.5% respectively.However, the team argues that risk percentages were extremely high in a select group of people and certain living environments. “While in the general population the prevalence of both HBV and HCV is about 1.93%, it is 5.05% in the slums. We held three camps in slums and screened more than 300 people, of this 16 were tested positive for hepatitis. While one of them had HCV, the rest carried HBV,” said liver transplant surgeon Dr Vivekanandan Shanmugam, who is the corresponding author of the study.“People are not aware that hepatitis, like HIV/AIDS, can spread through bodily fluids or unsafe sex. Sharing razors during a shave or sharing needles can cause the infection. In dialysis units, the infections can spread quickly if separate machines are not used for people with infection,” he said, calling for a massive awareness programme.In 2014, at least 16 people undergoing treatment at the Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital in Chennai were tested positive for hepatitis. Some of them died.Hepatitis or inflammation of the liver drastically alters or affects its function.Besides dialysis units and slums, high prevalence was seen in children living in the orphanages. “Most of these children were probably born to parents who were infected. At least 3.5% of children in orphanages were tested positive,” said liver transplant surgeon Hemalatha Varadan, who was part of the study.Most infants with the infection have it for life. “It is hence extremely important for a robust vaccination and awareness programme,” said senior gastroentric surgeon Dr RP Shanmugam, who founded the Chennai Liver Foundation."
Non-alcoholic liver disease emerges as a big worry; 1 in 5 may have it in some form,2018-07-20,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News,Civic Issues News","MUMBAI: While alcohol led to a 65% increase in deaths due to liver damage in the US in the past 17 years, Indian doctors say non-alcoholic liver disease is emerging as a greater worry in India.The American study published in BMJ, formerly British Medical Journal, on Thursday also said that the 25-34 age group has the maximum victims of liver disease caused by alcohol.While there is no equivalent data in India, local doctors say that one in five Indians has some form of liver disease.“Non-alcoholic fatty liver is one of the biggest problems,” said liver specialist Dr Samir Shah. This could be caused by obesity or diseases such as diabetes or high cholesterol “In western India, we see many patients with liver disease from Gujarat which is a ‘dry’ state,” he added.Liver specialist Dr Aabha Nagral said she sees seven to eight new patients with fatty liver every day. “Most corporate hospitals do health checkup and every other person in these checkups has a fatty liver.”Moreover, while liver disease is associated with obesity, doctors say there are several thin Indians with fatty livers too. “If a person with the beginning of alcohol-caused liver disease stops drinking, there is a possibility that his organ will regenerate on its own. But there is no such equivalent measure for a non-alcoholic liver disease patient,” said Dr Nagral.Not every person with a fatty liver develops liver failure though. “Around 20-30% of people with fatty liver will see the same progression as alcoholdamaged liver patients. Their liver will get scarred and there is a risk of developing cirrhosis and subsequently cancer,” said Dr Shah. The problem is pinpointing which of the 20% with fatty liver will develop cirrhosis. As many patients remain asymptomatic for years, there is a high possibility of liver failure being diagnosed too late.“Liver disease is assuming epidemic proportions in India as well. The World Health Organisation has said that deaths due to liver disease caused by hepatitis viruses is more than the deaths caused by HIV , TB and malaria together,” he said.In December 2017, Lancet medical journal carried a study that said liver disease would overtake heart disease by 2020 as the leading killer in the UK.Liver surgeon Dr Anand Khakhar’s Centre for Liver Disease and Transplantation said, “A sedentary lifestyle, increased alcohol consumption and obesity are contributing towards making India the world capital of liver diseases.”"
India sees major reductions in HIV infections: UN report,2018-07-20,UNITED NATIONS,"News,India News","UNITED NATIONS: India saw a major reduction in the number of new HIV infections, AIDS-related deaths and people living with HIV from 2010 to 2017 on the back of sustained and focussed efforts, according to a UN report which warned that the epidemic was growing in Pakistan.The Joint UN Agency on AIDS (UNAIDS) report titled 'Miles to go -- closing gaps, breaking barriers, righting injustices' said Asia and the Pacific regions have made strong inroads with its HIV response.Sustained and focused efforts to reach key populations have led to major reductions in HIV infections in Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam between 2010 and 2017.The report, however, warned that the global new HIV infections were not declining fast enough. It also noted that the epidemics were expanding in Pakistan and the Philippines.In India, new HIV infections dropped from 120,000 in 2010 to 88,000 in 2017, AIDS-related deaths from 160,000 to 69,000 and people living with HIV from 2,300,000 to 2,100,000 in the same time period, the report said.India has an approved social protection strategy, policy or framework that is being implemented, it said.Successive surveys in Cambodia, India, Thailand and Vietnam also indicate that attitudes towards people living with HIV have improved creating safer working conditions for sex workers and engaging them closely in the design and implementation of programmes make a huge difference, it said.The report underscored the public health benefits of decriminalising sex work.It found that countries that had decriminalised at least some aspects of sex work have fewer sex workers living with HIV than countries that criminalise all aspects of sex work.Modelling based on data from Canada, India and Kenya indicates that the decriminalisation of sex work could avert 33-46 per cent of HIV infections over the course of a decade.The report cited the example of Karnataka, where advocacy work with senior police officials, sensitisation workshops and the inclusion of HIV and human rights topics in pre-service curricula led to significant decreases in the arrest of female sex workers, especially during police raids.Before the interventions, half (50 per cent) of the 4,110 surveyed female sex workers said they had been arrested or detained at some point during police raids, that proportion shrank to 20 per cent after the interventions, the report said.Referring to the initiative sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to reduce the spread of HIV in India, the report said the Avahan programme in Karnataka and other States remained a ""sterling example"" of the impact of combining condom programming with community empowerment and structural improvements that tackle stigma, violence and unsafe working environments.UNAIDS, however, issued a stark wake-up call for nations, warning that the global response to HIV is at a precarious point.At the halfway point to the 2020 targets, the report warned that the pace of progress was not matching global ambition.""We are sounding the alarm"", said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of UNAIDS.""Entire regions are falling behind, the huge gains we made for children are not being sustained, women are still most affected, resources are still not matching political commitments and key populations continue to be ignored. All these elements are halting progress and urgently need to be addressed head-on,"" Sidibe said.Global new HIV infections have declined by just 18 per cent in the past seven years, from 2.2 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2017, the report noted.Although this is nearly half the number of new infections compared to the peak in 1996 (3.4 million), the decline is not quick enough to reach the target of fewer than 500,000 by 2020.In 2017, an estimated 36.9 million people globally were living with HIV and 21.7 million people were accessing treatment, it said.The report also shows that key populations are not being considered enough in HIV programming.Key populations and their sexual partners account for 47 per cent of the new HIV infections worldwide and 97 per cent of new HIV infections in eastern Europe and central Asia, where one third of new HIV infections are among people who inject drugs.""The right to health for all is non-negotiable,"" said Sidibe.""Sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, prisoners, migrants, refugees and transgender people are more affected by HIV but are still being left out from HIV programmes. More investments are needed in reaching these key populations,"" Sidibe added."
cancer insurance: Why insurance against cancer is critical,2018-07-23,NEW DELHI,"News,BUSINESS NEWS,India Business News","NEW DELHI: The dreaded C-word is in the news after actor Sonali Bendre disclosed that she has cancer. Earlier, actor Irrfan Khan had made his fight against the disease public, adding to the awareness about cancer and its treatment.However, the level of preparedness for managing the financial aspect of the treatment remains low despite life insurers actively promoting policies that offer targeted protection. Recently, health insurer Star Health also launched a policy aimed at cancer survivors. “The sensitivity towards buying insurance to cover this disease is low. Distributors do not sell these policies as much as they promote policies with a savings element,” says Anilkumar Singh, Chief Actuarial Officer, Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Cancer is now responsible for almost one in six deaths globally. With huge treatment costs, cancer policies can play a crucial role.The sum insured can be as high as ₹60 lakh and these policies cover cancer right from the early to the advanced stages. Future premiums are waived off on detection for three to five years to ease the burden on policyholders.The claim settlement process is simple, as these are fixed benefit policies that hand out a pre-defined sum on diagnosis. Unlike regular health insurance covers, the cancer policy payout can be used to meet any recuperation-related expenses as well. Also on offer are increased sum assured options under premium variants, where the cover increases by 10% for every claim-free year. Income benefit is another feature that can help during the recovery phase, particularly if the health condition is debilitating enough to force a break from employment.Despite the benefits, the policies have met with moderate response. “In India, a number of cancer products have been launched and uptake of cancer cover over time may increase, with increasing awareness levels, higher incidence of the disease, improving medical support and higher cost of treatment,” says Khalid Ahmad, Head, Products, PNB MetLife.Unlike life insurers’ cancer covers, Star Health’s Cancer Care plan extends cover to those who have been diagnosed with cancer (stage 1 or 2). Launched as a pilot, the product covers the risk of recurrence, metastasis, second cancer as well as second malignancy unrelated to first cancer, apart from regular hospitalisation expenses.Study the exclusions and restrictions before you take a call. Cancer policies from life insurers restrict coverage for early-stage cancers to 20-25% of the sum insured. Later-stage cancer claims will be eligible for the entire sum assured minus claim paid out, if any, during initial stages. While, some plans provide a sum assured of 150% for major stage cancer, check if any particular cancer and recurrent claims of cancer affecting the same organs are excluded. For instance, Aegon Life’s policy does not cover skin cancer.Standard exclusions like pre-existing illness apart, cancer caused by sexually transmitted diseases, HIV, or AIDS or arising out of congenital condition and contact with radiation or radioactivity, are not covered under these policies.A cancer cover will not be of help in case you contract other critical diseases. A regular critical illness policy or a rider covers a range of serious ailments. Therefore, you will have to make the choice on the basis of your health condition as well as family health history. Also ensure you have a basic health insurance policy in place to cover hospitalisation."

"No awareness, labourers miss out on critical care aid plan",2018-07-23,Bijnor,"News,City News,Meerut News","Bijnor: Owing to lack of awareness about a government scheme , managed by the Labour Department, which allows critically ill labourers and their families to avail monetary assistance from the state government, none of the 1.17 lakh registered labourers in the district have availed it in the last five years since 2013, when it was launched.Talking to TOI, Chandrapal Saini of Mandawali village, a mason by profession, said, “My wife was diagnosed with cancer last year, but I failed to treat her as I did not have any money. She eventually succumbed to the disease. No one had told me about the government scheme. The Labour Department should publicize it so that all needy labourers can avail it. It is the fault of department officers.”A labourer or his or her family member, suffering from an illness like cancer, a cardiovascular disease requiring bypass surgery, a disease requiring kidney, liver or knee transplant, HIV AIDS, backbone surgery, brain surgery, surgery of appendix, surgery of hydrocele etc., can avail the scheme. The patient has to first get admitted to the district hospital. A proposal is then sent to the state government, from where funds are granted for required treatment.To be a beneficiary of the scheme, a labourer has to be enrolled with the Labour Department. One would need to pay a registration fee of Rs 60 for three years. Also, a labourer would need to do construction work for 90 days in a year to get a certificate from the construction company or the contractor concerned. Around 1.17 lakh labourers are enrolled with the Labour Department. In the absence of awareness, according to officials, not a single person in Bijnor has applied to avail the scheme since 2013.On being asked about the scheme, assistant commissioner of Labour Department, Ghanshyam Singh, confirmed that no labourer from Bijnor had availed the scheme. “While some patients did apply, they didn’t know the rules and were unsure how to go about it. The scheme requires a patient to be admitted in the district hospital, from where they can be referred to a government medical college of a higher centre, but some tried to avail the scheme by being admitted at a private hospital,” he said.“Labourers are largely illiterate and are not aware of the scheme. However, we are working on making it more popular. Construction workers at roads, bridges and buildings, carpenters, welders, roller drivers, masons, plumbers, decorators, mechanics, miners etc. are eligible for the scheme.”"
Cash-strapped NMC spent Rs 18.46 lakh on sports events,2018-07-24,Nagpur,"News,City News,Nagpur News","Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s transport committee, led by its chairman and BJP corporator Bunty Kukde, on Monday approved Rs 18.46 lakh spent on providing green buses to ferry players, coaches and officials who had come to Nagpur for the Asian School Badminton Championship and Khasdar Krida Mahotsav.This expenditure comes at a time when the civic body incurred a loss of Rs 23.35 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal. During the recently-concluded school badminton championship, held from July 6 to July 13, the NMC’s transport department, as a mobility partner, had provided eight air-conditioned green buses free of cost. It incurred a cost of Rs 12 lakh.The panel also gave nod to department’s expenditure of Rs 6,46,778 for providing air-conditioned buses for Khasdar Krida Mahotsav held in May this year.The committee, however, withheld the income and expenditure statements for three months (April-June) of the current fiscal. As per the statement, the department generated Rs 16.06 crore through sale of tickets as against expenditure of Rs 39.41 crore. Kukde, however, said the account statements of these three months have been kept on hold as additional municipal commissioner was not present for the meeting.The committee also passed the department’s proposal to provide free bus pass for HIV/AIDS patients, said Kukde. The panel cleared the proposal along with some changes and it included free bus pass facility for cancer patients too.

"UN draft on TB sparks fears of India, Brazil succumbing to US pressure",2018-07-24,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: Public health activists fear that India, Brazil and other developing countries could be caving in to US pressure going by the latest version of the UN’s draft political declaration on tuberculosis (TB). The declaration to be adopted by heads of state at a high-level meeting in New York in September this year will set the direction for the global fight against TB, including access to TB medicines.The G-77 group of countries, which includes India, has been under tremendous pressure to drop all references to the flexibilities and safeguards available within trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS). These are meant to protect a country’s right to take policy measures required to ensure access to affordable medicines for its citizens. They, for instance, allow governments to issue compulsory licenses to override patents in the interest of public health, so that they can allow generic versions to be produced or imported.Alarmed by reports of US pressure on G-77, public health activists have urged India not to give in to such pressure. Ashwani Mahajan of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch tweeted tagging external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj , appealing to her not to cave in to US pressure tactics as “TRIPS flexibilities are key to protecting public health”. “India should come forward to protect the interests of developing countries as it has always done. I have messaged the health ministry and PMO also,” said Mahajan.What has alarmed these activists is the change in the draft declaration being negotiated by UN member countries. The draft as it stood on July 20 had dropped all references to the WTO’s Doha declaration that enshrined public health flexibilities and safeguards in the TRIPS agreement. This was a clear shift from the July 10 draft. Instead, the new draft has introduced a phrase about how “intellectual property rights are an important incentive in the development of new health products”.“How is it possible that global leaders will gather for the first time to decide how to tackle the world’s most deadly infectious killer disease, and yet some countries backed by their big pharma lobbies are pushing to remove any mention of the need for vital medicines to be affordable?” asked Sharonann Lynch, HIV and TB Advisor for MSF’s Access Campaign. “Drug-resistant-TB is a public health emergency, so clearly the world is going to need to kick the response to this disease into high gear. Blocking more affordable generic versions of safer oral medicines needed to scale up treatments for people with drug resistant TB will not be the way to do it.”""The G-77 will be meeting to review the draft later this evening, India time.""“We’re appealing to all countries, including those in the Group of 77, and Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, that have a high burden of TB, to urgently stand up right now against bullying that aims to keep medicines out of the hands of your people who need treatment,” said Leena Menghaney, South Asia Head for MSF’s Access Campaign. “This upcoming TB Summit is such an important opportunity to reaffirm countries’ rights to make medicines affordable for their people – don’t waste this moment.”"

"Termed sterling example by UN agency, Avahan reduced Karnataka’s HIV burden",2018-07-26,BENGALURU,"News,City News,Bengaluru News,Civic Issues","BENGALURU: Aishwarya (name changed) was a sex worker living on the edge of penury. She, however, didn’t become a victim of HIV . Fighting stigma, she groomed her self-confidence and started saving for her sons’ education. Today, her elder son, an MTech holder, works in Hyderabad, while her younger son is pursuing undergraduate engineering.Like Aishwarya, thousands of sex workers and sexual minorities have successfully kept HIV at bay and changed their lives drastically, thanks to project Avahan . The initiative focuses on integrating biological and behavioural aspects of target groups and empowering them with peer education.Avahan has been described as a “sterling example” in the recent report released by the joint UN Agency on AIDS ( UNAIDS ). Between 2003-12, the project, funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and University of Manitoba in Canada, reached out to 65,000 sex workers and over 25,000 sexual minorities. As per a survey, the findings of which were reported in British Medical Journal, the prevalence of HIV in Karnataka reduced from 19.6% to 10.8% and of syphilis (another sexually transmitted disease ) from 5.9% to 2.4%, with the increased use of condoms. Avahan, which targeted 16 districts of Karnataka, was credited for the achievement.“We got an identity. We ensured that we protected ourselves even while in the job. I am now into counselling and am leading a better life. I was able to save money for my children’s education,” said Aishwarya, who is no longer in sex work.What made Avahan a successful model was that it never took a moral and judgemental view, says H L Mohan, managing trustee, Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), who spearheaded the project.According to a Lancet report, Avahan prevented no less than six lakh HIV cases in India. Karnataka was one of the six states chosen for the project, and here, it was executed by KHPT from 2003 to 2012.The programme not only brought in mandatory condom usage but also worked for the community members’ empowerment. Clinics were set up where members went for fortnightly tests. The project also helped them save money in cooperative societies run by themselves. Drop-in centres were established at the hotspots, where sex workers could walk in at any time to relax, watch TV and consult doctors. In Bengaluru, the centres were set up in Yeshwantpur, Shivajinagar and Malleswaram and were functional 24/7.With every fortnightly visit, members of the vulnerable section understood the complexity of the situation they were in. “We set up cooperative societies run by sex workers, so that they can save money and don’t have to borrow from money lenders. We have even saved many young girls from being trafficked,” said Mohan.In 2013, when the project ended, the centres were subsumed with the government. “Avahan should have been an ongoing project to make the state HIV-free,” added Mohan. Even now, KHPT gets visitors from abroad who come to study the model that led to HIV prevention.No mean featTo win the confidence of sex workers and work with them in risk-reduction interventions wasn’t easy to begin with. Usage of condoms alone wouldn’t have worked unless we reduced their vulnerability. We had to closely work with them to understand the strategy to safeguard them from infections. We did a hotspot mapping involving them. The strategy was different for each district. While home-based prostitution was seen more in districts like Shivamogga, street-based work was more prevalent in places like Davanagere, Ballari and BengaluruH L Mohan, managing trustee, KHPT"
Six Jind jail inmates found HIV+ve: Six Jind jail inmates found HIV+ve,2018-07-26,By,"News,City News,Chandigarh News","By: Vijender KumarJIND: A health check-up conducted in the jail here has found six inmates to be HIV positive. Jind civil surgeon Dr Sanjay Dahiya said a district health department team had examined 435 inmates at a camp held in the jail from July 19 and 24. He said 16 inmates were found positive for hepatitis C virus and six were suffering from venereal disease related to sexual infections.The health department conducted the camp in association with the Jind jail administration under the supervision of CMO and two other doctors, including a lady doctor. Dr Dahiya said out of the six HIV positive cases, one was an old patient already undergoing treatment while the other five had been lodged in the jail recently.The CMO also about 40 to 50 women inmates were also screened during the camp and found to be free from any ailments. He said 300 inmates were yet to be examined by the health department.He said the HIV positive inmates would have to get their treatment card made from PGIMS, Rohtak , while the district health department would start their treatment in the jail.“Earlier, the HIV positive patients had to go to the antiretroviral (ART) centre in the PGIMS for treatment but now the district health team started providing the facility to them in Jind. Our unit is now linked with the ART centre of the PGIMS,” Dr Dahiya said.He said the department was concerned about the health of jail inmates and would continue conducting such checkups in future. Dr Dahiya said he was not sure about how the inmates contracted the HIV-positive illness.Jind jail superintendent Harinder Singh said they used to organize such health check-up camps earlier as well. “Those who were found to be HIV positive were lodged in the jail only recently. We will look after these inmates,” he stated."
Government to launch national programme for prevention & control of hepatitis on July 28,2018-07-26,LUCKNOW,"News,India News","LUCKNOW: Over one crore Indians are carrying the hepatitis C virus infection, according to a review of some 300 studies on the prevalence of the disease in India. Undertaken by the department of gastroenterology, SGPGIMS, which is one of a few select World Health Organisation Collaborating Centres for Viral Hepatitis across the globe, the review revealed that 0.5-1% of the general Indian population carries the hepatitis C virus. Considering the current Indian population of 132 crore, the number translates into a whopping 66 lakh to 1.32 crore persons.The findings have served as the basis for formulation of the National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme, being rolled out by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on July 28, which is observed every year as the World Hepatitis Day.The ministry has already formulated the draft operational guidelines as a part of an integrated initiative for prevention and control of viral hepatitis. As per the report, “SGPGIMS undertook a systematic review of available information from published studies and from large unpublished reliable datasets, to assess the prevalence of chronic HCV infection in the Indian population. The data was analysed for quality and to assess the prevalence of overall HCV infections, and by age, sex, risk factors and place in the country.”Associate Professor, gastroenterology, SGPGI, Dr Amit Goel who conducted the review, said, “The meta-analysis included more than 300 studies representing all states and union territories except Lakshadweep”. He added that around 70% of persons tested positive for hepatitis C blood test needed treatment. Prevalence of hepatitis C in the high-risk groups such as persons living with HIV , those suffering with diseases such as haemophilia , thalassemia was found to be 30-40%.”Experts at SGPGI point out that over 2,500 patients of hepatitis B and C report to gastroenterology department of SGPGI annually. Specific observations indicate that 10-12% patients report in terminal stages of the disease, where treatments often do not work. This is an irony of sorts as hepatitis C, if diagnosed early, is curable with a 3-month course of available drugs. These drugs are easy to take, safe and also very cheap.Senior faculty, gastroenterology SGPGI, Prof Rakesh Aggarwal, who is a member of the WHO’s Scientific and Technical Advisory Group on Viral Hepatitis, shared that the investment in viral hepatitis prevention and control is in public interest. “Investment in hepatitis C treatment will be paid back within seven years as the money that goes in managing the complications of the disease would be saved,” he explained.Head of surgical gastroenterology, King George's Medical University, Prof Abhijit Chandra welcomed the move stating that prevention was a must for liver diseases. ""Viruses causing hepatitis B and C nibble the liver for several years before the problem caused by them comes to light. But by this time, a simple infection develops into a disease called chronic hepatitis — the commonest cause of cirrhosis and liver cancers.""It is for this that gastroenterologists in the world emphasise on prevention of the disease. ""Immunisation has led to a 20-fold reduction in hepatitis B cases in 150 countries of the world where infants are routinely given the vaccine,” shared Prof Chandra welcoming the move."

79 jail inmates discharged from JJ; 4 still being treated,2018-07-22,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: JJ Hospital on Saturday evening discharged 79 Byculla jail women inmates who were admitted after they complained of dehydration and vomiting on Friday. Four women with low haemoglobin are still undergoing treatment, while an HIV-positive male is under observation.Maharashtra State Commission for Women members visited the jail and met the patients at the hospital. They said they will send a notice to the jail. Hospital sources indicated the infection was probably due to contaminated water . Around 7pm, the hospital said three more females and five more males were under observation as they complained of abdomen pain, vomiting, dehydration and loose motions. Hospital sources said this almost negated the possibility of medicines causing a problem. No male inmates were hospitalised.Advocate Asha Landge said, “We spoke to all inmates in the ward. Around 15 said they had not taken the medicine (doxycycline) but still fell ill.” Representatives had visited the prison in April and released a report on legal aid problems faced by inmates. Vindatai Kirtikar, a member, said, “The women had then only spoken about inept legal aid. We had food and water there, and it seemed hygienic. Now, many complained about food and water given in the last three-four days.” She added, “We will immediately send them a notice and plan a surprise inspection soon.”JJ dean Dr Mukund Tayade said three pregnant inmates will stay at the gynaecology ward. Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicines and head of the medical unit, said, “The male has loose motions and since he is HIV-positive we have to keep him under observation. We are giving blood to those with low haemoglobin and hopefully they will recover soon.”Dr Aneesh V from the general medicine department said, “Tests on blood samples of inmates showed they had less electrolytes. It could be a monsoon-related bacterial infection.” The discharged inmates have been prescribed medicines relating the gastritis."
Lok Sabha clears law to deal with human trafficking,2018-07-27,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha passed a comprehensive law to contain human trafficking on Thursday with WCD minister Maneka Gandhi assuring the House that the legislation did not intend to harass sex workers and was ""victim centric"".The bill covers ""aggravated"" forms of trafficking for forced labour, child bearing, begging and marriage and lays down stringent punishment for those found guilty. The punishment for such crimes will not be less than 10 years imprisonment and may extend to life in jail and a fine of not less than Rs 1 lakh. Repeat offenders will face jail for the rest of their life and a minimum fine of Rs 2 lakh.In a first, the bill rates offences like administration of hormones for early sexual maturity, exposing a person to life threatening illness like HIV and abetting a person to illegally migrate as ""aggravated trafficking offences"".Introducing the Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2018 , in Lok Sabha, Maneka said the bill provided for attachment and confiscation of illicit assets born out of trafficking crimes.The bill provides for confidentiality of victims, witnesses and complainants, time-bound trials and repatriation of victims. The law envisages setting up of a 'National Anti-Trafficking Bureau' under the home ministry to deal with all forms of human trafficking.""This bill is not intended to harass those sex workers who are voluntarily in the profession. This is a bill that has a compassionate view of people who have been victims of sex racket,"" Maneka said.Justifying the need for the law, she said, ""When 11-year-old Tara is trafficked from her village and sold into bonded labour, beaten and burnt by her owner, how do we save her? When she is sold to marriage to a 45-year-old man and raped every day for months, how do we save her? We have no institutions, no processes to do so. And today, if we are not passing this bill, we are choosing to deny Tara and all the millions like her fundamental right to life and liberty."""
"Blood bank sealed in Jalandhar, records seized",2018-08-05,JALANDHAR,"News,City News,Ludhiana News","JALANDHAR: The health department has sealed a private blood bank in Jalandhar and seized its records after finding major irregularities in its operations following a surprise raid on Friday night. The team found 44 units of blood lying in the open at ‘Rakat Vahini India’ running from Gulab Devi Hospital when it raided the premises following a tip off by activists of an NGO.“We were already suspecting irregularities in the blood bank. On Friday night, we were informed by the staff of a private hospital that they had been provided two units of blood bearing same donation number. We reached the blood bank immediately and even informed the authorities,” said Neeraj Bakshi of Hindustan Welfare Blood Donors Club, Phagwara. The club has a network of over 5,000 blood donors and is involved in promoting volunteer blood donation.On Saturday evening Zonal Licensing Authority Karun Sachdev said they had seized 44 units of blood and record of the blood bank. “Initial investigations reveal glaring violations of rules of storing and handling the blood,” he said. Out of the 44 units seized, 25 were lying outside the refrigerators when they should have been stored at 2-6 degree temperature, he said. “Donation and expiry dates were also not mentioned on the blood bags. All the seized bags should now be tested for HIV , Hepatitis C and B virus among others, as is the standard procedure to find out if infected blood was also being issued for patients,” he added.The blood bank is owned by Dr I G Aggarwal, originally from Tohana in Haryana. “He runs around 10 blood banks in Punjab and Haryana,” said Bakshi.ACP Dalbir Singh Buttar said that a case was also being registered against the accused."
"In Punjab, 4 samples in drug deaths tested positive each month",2018-08-05,CHANDIGARH,"News,City News,Chandigarh News,Civic Issues","CHANDIGARH: Viscera sample in 49 suspected drug overdose deaths tested positive for narcotics and psychotropic substances at the state government-run Chemical Examiner Lab, Kharar, between August 2017 and July 2018, according to data. This takes the monthly average to four.The figure was the highest in the month of July, when 23 viscera samples tested positive. This, however, does not mean that these 49 people died of a drug overdose, as there are plenty of other reasons behind such fatalities, said experts. They said the viscera report, even if the sample tests positive for narcotics and psychotropic substances, is to be studied along with the postmortem report to corroborate the main cause.Data with the laboratory showed that 40 viscera samples tested positive for morphine (opioids), one for cocaine, two for tramadol (drug to treat pain), and six for benzodiazepines (drug to treat anxiety). As on August 1, 45 viscera cases were pending for reporting at the laboratory.Health and family welfare minister Brahm Mohindra said, “Chemical examiner laboratory does not declare the cause of death and it is done by the medical officer concerned, after taking into consideration viscera report as well as the postmortem report.” He said as a norm, viscera reports are sent to the SSPs or commissioners of police concerned, and these are then sent to the medical officer who has conducted postmortem, to declare the cause of death after taking into consideration postmortem findings as well as pathological reports.Following a spurt in suspected drug overdose deaths in recent past, Kharar laboratory was flooded with viscera samples from across Punjab. As per laboratory data, 73 viscera samples of suspected drug overdose deaths were allotted to seven analysts at the laboratory in July. In 14 such cases, the laboratory also got syringes with needles and utensils. Of the total viscera cases, 32 samples were analysed and 23 found positive for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, two for celphos (aluminium phosphide, an agricultural pesticide) and one for chorocompounds (insecticides), says the laboratory report.The list of suspected drug overdose viscera cases sent to Kharar laboratory, accessed by TOI, reveal the police have registered FIRs and daily diary reports (DDRs) in these cases under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Though most of the DDRs have been registered under Section 174 of CrPC (police to enquire and report on suicide), some FIRs have been registered for abetment of suicide, murder, causing hurt by means of poison with intent to commit an offence and culpable homicide not amounting to murder.Therefore, the experts are of the view that a person who has committed suicide after having drugs cannot be said to have died of drugs. Or, if a person under the influence of drugs had gotten into a fight and died in the attack cannot be said to have died of a drug overdose. Dr P D Garg, head of the psychiatry department of Government Medical College, Amritsar, and director of Swami Vivakanand De-addiction Centre, said, “It is necessary to analyse viscera as well as postmortem to reach the conclusion about the cause of death. There are so many reasons since the drug addict is prone to suicide, homicide, and violence. A drug addict can die due to pneumonia, which is very common due to complications of heroin addiction and HIV .”Kharar laboratory records as on July 25 show that of the total 82 visceras of suspected drug overdose deaths, 36 were of people in the age group of 21-25 years, 24 in the age group of 26-30 years, eight below 20 years, and 14 above 30 years."

All the seized bags should now be tested for HIV Hepatitis C and B virus among others, as is the standard procedure to find out if infected blood was also being issued for patients,” he added.The blood bank is owned by Dr I G Aggarwal, originally from Tohana in Haryana. “He runs around 10 blood banks in Punjab and Haryana ,” said Bakshi.ACP Dalbir Singh Buttar said that a case was also being registered against the accused."
"NU scraps norm barring AIDS, leprosy patientsfrom its hostel",2018-08-07,Nagpur,"News,City News,Nagpur News","Nagpur: The Nagpur University (NU) on Monday repealed the controversial guideline prohibiting HIV/AIDS-affected students from seeking accommodation to its hostels.The move came following protests by students and different organizations, whose representatives met vice-chancellor SP Kane and demanded immediate withdrawal of the condition.Agreeing to scrap the norm, Kane steered clear of the controversy saying the conditions were not laid during his tenure but had been carried forward over the years.Interestingly, though the now-repealed hostel rules barred students suffering from epilepsy, AIDS, Hepatitis B, heart diseases, leprosy and mental disorder from getting hostel facility, no medical tests were conducted for inmates over the years. In fact, the hostel committee had left it up to the students to produce a medical certificate to prove their fitness.Postgraduate student Vikesh Timande was the first to red flag the controversial norm.Timande is an applicant for hostel accommodation and had noticed that the disease was mentioned under different types of prohibitions. “I was going through the terms and conditions for hostel accommodation. I realized that the diseases mentioned in the list breached constitutional rights of an individual,” he said.Without wasting time, Timande initiated an online campaign and also researched on the issue. “I came to know that some students were discriminated on the basis of they being HIV+. I called up the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) helpline. They suggested that I move the court,” he said.However, second-year students first decided to discuss the matter with the NU administration along with some of his classmates. “The VC instantly agreed to repeal the clause. I am appalled that no one took note of it all these years,” Timande said.Based on Timande’s campaign, National Students Union of India (NSUI) activists led by Aamir Noori too met the VC and demanded withdrawal of the norm.Director of students welfare department Dilip Kawadkar said no one has ever been denied accommodation in the hostel on the grounds of his/her health status. “It was brought to our attention by students only. I would immediately issue correction (shuddhipatra) in this regard and amend the guidelines by putting up the matter before the relevant authority,” Kawadkar said."
mumbai hiv patients: Relief for HIV patients: They can now take home 3 months’ drugs,2018-08-08,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News,Civic Issues News","MUMBAI: For people living with HIV , receiving medicines is as much of a challenge as keeping the virus in check. Every once a month, the person must seek leave from the workplace, arrive early in the morning to a hospital, beat the crowds and queue up for hours to collect the antiretroviral medicines.For a section of people living with HIV, this situation will soon change. In a first, the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has decided to give patients the medicine stock for 90-days at a time. Currently, most patients are handed stocks for a month, and in rare instances, for two months. People living with HIV have long wanted this option, which has been tried with success in several African countries.Termed as Differentiated Service Delivery Model (DSDM), it has already been rolled out at ten centres across the country, including KEM Hospital in Parel. Patients, though, will have to meet several criteria to be eligible for DSDM. “Primarily, it will be given to those who have been on treatment for at least a year and have 95% adherence rate. The individual has to be clinically fit and free of any side-effects and opportunistic infections (such as tuberculosis) at the time of enrolment,” said Dr RS Gupta, deputy director, NACO. “Besides making it easier for patients, it will also help to decongest the ART centres,” he added.At KEM, over 500 patients have already been identified and enrolled into the programme. The Parel hospital caters to over 1500 people living with HIV. “Patients often have problems seeking frequent leaves from their workplace. This initiative will save them repeated visits only for drug refill. It will also save travel costs,” said Dr Srikala Acharya, assistant project director at the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS). She added that only patients on the first line of treatment and CD4 count (a vital parameter) of more than 500 will be considered for DSDM.Besides Mumbai’s KEM, centres at Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Benaras, and designated hospitals in Manipur, Bhagalpur and Raipur are rolling out the initiative. Talking to TOI, a person living with HIV hailed the model and said it was long-awaited and will go a long way in making life easy for patients. “Most HIV-affected people continue to live in anonymity. It, therefore, becomes difficult to explain in offices why one needs to leave every month on fixed days,” said the 42-year-old central Mumbai resident.Members of the civil society too have welcomed the decision but cautioned that support systems have to be strengthened for the model to succeed. “It’s a great initiative particularly for patients who have to visit resource-strapped health facilities. In Mumbai, 17 ART centres cater to nearly 35000 patients. Decongestion of these centres will allow counsellors to spend more time with patients,” said HIV activist Ganesh Acharya. However, he said for DSDM to succeed, counselling facilities must be enhanced.Echoing the same, Sachin Awasthi from Vihaan, a patients’ group that works towards improving adherence, said that the monthly meeting with counsellors and caregivers play an important role. “We have to ensure that patients don’t start taking their regimes casually,” he said."
"In this UP government shelter home, 12 women died of illness in a year",2018-08-08,BAREILLY,"News,City News,Bareilly News","BAREILLY: Not just sexual assault, poor and homeless women lodged in UP shelter homes have to also endure unhealthy living conditions. The shelter home in Bareilly , which has a capacity to house 125 inmates, is home to 205 women. In the past year, 12 of them have succumbed to illness. Officials said that due to lack of adequate infrastructure and staff, it is a challenge to run the facility properly.According to deputy chief probation officer Nita Ahirwar, women inmates who died in the shelter home over the past year were between the ages of 22 and 65. “Most of them had been suffering from mental illness while some had multiple diseases, including infections at an advanced stage, malnutrition and anemia . Last year three women from Ajmer in Rajasthan were admitted here with infections at advanced stages. Two of them died within a month of being admitted,” she said. One of the inmates, who is HIV positive, was admitted here after court orders.The shelter home is divided into two parts. One is for mentally ill women while the other one is for those who are sent here after magistrate’s orders. These include women who have been abandoned by their partners after eloping from home and women rescued from human traffickers.For mentally ill persons, the facility has a capacity to house 100 inmates but currently has 150. The other section has a capacity of 25, but houses 55 at present.“In case of any ailment, inmates are provided treatment at government hospitals, which everyone knows cannot match the facilities provided at private hospitals. However, we provide them all possible treatment and medicines but it becomes very difficult to save those inmates who are admitted after they have reached an advanced stage of an illness,” Ahirwar added.Two nurses, a superintendent and two assistants are deputed at the shelter home. All the other employees are hired on a contractual basis, for which the government releases grants twice a year.“We often face difficulties since the funds are released quite late. All contractual staff including two sanitary workers, two helpers and two cooks are paid salaries once the funds are released,” Ahirwar added.Asked how they manage to keep 55 inmates while they have a capacity to house only 25 in the second section Ahirwar said, “We have a big hall there. We have beds and all other things in adequate number for the inmates. Besides, we used to send the estimate for their diet, following that government releases funds every month.”District magistrate Virendra Kumar Singh said, “Following instructions we received on Monday, five magistrates visited all shelter homes in the city. They made a thorough inspection to ensure everything was in order. We sent a report to the government on the same day.”"

ART data shows drop in HIV+ cases across district,2018-08-08,Nashik,"News,City News,Nashik News","Nashik: If the data furnished by the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre — the only government clinic in the district to treat all HIV/AIDS patients — is anything to go by, then there is a declining trend of HIV/AIDS patients in the district.As per the data, even death cases of such patients are decreasing. Also, it is for the first time in the last 10 years, the number of HIV positive patients coming at the ART centre had dropped below 1,000.Sunil Thakur, head of the ART centre on the premises of Nashik civil hospital, said there is awareness among people due to which the number has reduced. “For the past many years, the government, health machineries are working hard to spread awareness. Lectures are being held continuously at the villages, schools and colleges,” he said.Most of the patients found living with HIV are from the lower socio-economic background and are found mainly in the age group of 20 to 24 years.Thakur said that with improved facilities at the centre a few years ago, there was a rise in number of people coming to get registered and start their treatment. However, in the fiscal year of 2017-18, only 998 new HIV patients came to the ART centre as against 1,153 in the previous year.With rising awareness about the best treatment that has been made available at the ART Centre, people are also coming at the HIV testing centres available at two hospitals, four sub-divisional hospitals, 24 rural hospitals apart from public health centres and urban health centres.Thakur said this year from March 2018 the viral load testing has also been started at the Nashik ART centre to check the gravity of the disease so that if the health of patients is not improving with the first line of treatment, the second line of treatment can be started.Meanwhile, the health machinery has even started to bring in HIV+ patients who had stopped their treatment mid-way.“The purpose was to bring the LFU (lost to follow up) patients under treatment as early as possible so that with proper treatment, their life span can be increased,” Thakur said.Medical experts at the ART centre said, “If diagnosed early and brought under treatment with proper ART treatment, HIV+ patients can live for more than 30 years. All the patients need to do is manage opportunistic infections from time to time which can be done by visiting the ART centres on a monthly basis.”For the convenience of patients, the health department has started 4 ART link centres in Manmad, Chandwad, Yeola and Niphad. A government health official said that over the years there has been a declining graph of detecting HIV+ patients. “The stigma attached to the disease is also fast vanishing, claimed medical officials,” he said.Meanwhile, the Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification test (CBNAAT) machine at the ART centre is also proving extremely helpful in accurate detection of tuberculosis among HIV positive patients as they are more vulnerable to contract TB.Over the years, the ART centre in Nashik have found approximately 15,000 HIV+ patients. Officials said the deaths were due to the concerned patients leaving hope and dropping their medication mid-way.Meanwhile, Ravindra Patil, president of Yash Foundation that works for the rehabilitation of HIV+ patients, said, “There is a possibility that a large number of patients take treatment in private hospitals. The figures of these patients are not available with the government department. If the private practitioners give their figures to the government department, the picture could be different. Still patients shy away from going to ART centre fearing that they could be noticed.”"

"HIV+ man acquitted of killing son, wife turns hostile",2018-08-17,Mumbai,"News,City News,Mumbai News","Mumbai: A 51-year-old HIV-positive man was recently acquitted of murdering his minor son in 2016 after his wife, the complainant in the case, turned hostile.

The child was found drowned in a nullah along the railway tracks.Observing that the homicidal death of the child was not proved, the sessions court also did not find the alleged motive convincing. “It is not believable that when his wife and daughter are suffering from HIV and they were taking treatment at a civil hospital in Jalna, then merely on suspicion that the deceased might be suffering from HIV, he would take such a drastic step of taking the life of his son,” the court said.The accused and his wife had six children.

6 suitors vie to take over daily operations at Jaslok Hospital,2018-08-18,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News,Civic Issues News","MUMBAI: Six suitors have shown interest to run the 350-bedded Jaslok Hospital on Peddar Road as the managing trust contemplates handing over operations and management control, said highly placed sources.Jaslok Hospital, often called the country’s first skyscraper hospital with 20 storeys, was set up in 1973 by the Chanrai family. It is recognised as one of the better trust-run hospitals in the city, and is credited with diagnosing the first HIV case in the city, among other medical achievements.“It is sad, but true that Jaslok Hospital is going to change hands,’’ said an old-timer on the condition of anonymity.Unlike Delhi, where corporate-run hospitals are common, trust-run hospitals have been synonymous with Mumbai’s healthcare scene and are known to offer free or subsidised healthcare to the economically weaker sections. When contacted, Jaslok Hospital CEO Jitendra Haryan’s team said there is no truth in media reports about the “sale” or “handover” of their hospital to a corporategroup.An official said the hospital wouldn’t like to give credence to market speculation. It is learnt that Radiant Life Care, Malaysian healthcare giant IHH Healthcare that recently acquired the Fortis he althcare chain of hospitals, Zydus Hospitals, and the Hinduja Group are among those considering a proposal to run Jaslok. Malaysia’s IHH is the world’s second largest hospital network and also operates Gleneagles Global hospital in Mumbai. Pankaj Patel-controlled Zydus Hospitals has a footprint in Gujarat. Abhay Soi-led Radiant operates Juhu’s Nanavati Hospital, another iconic trust-owned healthcare provider.An international consulting and audit firm is advising the trust to find a strategic partner to run Jaslok, said the highly placed source.“Trust-run hospitals cannot be sold,” said a Jaslok Hospital official. However, a senior doctor pointed out that trusts can enter into a lease agreement with a corporate entity to run the hospital.Nanavati Hospital in Vile Parle (W) is a case in point. Trust-owned hospitals are increasingly handing over daily operations to professional, corporate chains to improve efficiency in a highly competitive market. However, the doctor feared that such a move would lead to increased corporatization of healthcare and increased costs."

drug addiction: Chandigarh: Synthetic drug use alarms PGI,2018-09-16,CHANDIGARH,"News,City News,Chandigarh News","CHANDIGARH: Doctors at the drug de-addiction centre in PGI fear the usage of costly amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), also called synthetic drugs, might increase in the city soon. PGI has seen 5-6 cases of ATS in combination with other drugs in the past year. “As these drugs are very costly, even 5-6 cases are startling. We fear the cases will increase in the future,” said Prof D Basu, drug de-addiction and treatment centre, PGI.The concern for the rise is based on the 2015 report of the United Nations office on drugs and crime, where out of five places from the country, Chandigarh was also included. “There were 100 ATS users who were interviewed, with 20 each from one of the five places. As many as 25% of this sample consisted of women. The 20 users from Chandigarh informed that they knew 8-10 more people who were into such drug abuse,” said Dr Basu. He said, “There is therefore a chain of hidden population who do not report to doctors.” The report cites the raw material for the synthesis of these ATS drugs are exported from India and China to the Middle East, Canada and Singapore.Psychiatrists in PGI said ATS in India is in three forms: ecstasy, ICE —crystalline methamphetamine in pure form and methamphetamine in crude form as tablets.“The northern states of the country has ICE, while north-eastern states have the tablets which are commonly used,” said Dr Basu. He said, “The cost of 1 gm of ICE is between Rs 10,000 and Rs 20,000 in the city, while the cost of heroin per gm is Rs 3,500.”Though cannabis is the topmost illicit drug worldwide, ATS comes next to it in usage. But ATS is usually consumed in combination and is comparatively dangerous that other opioids.“Also, there is no specific treatment for the ATS drug users who are only given cognitive therapy. As ATS has stimulant properties, it makes a person feel more strongly bonded with strangers and can result in casual sexual behaviour and therefore the risk of HIV.”"
Private drug de-addiction centres to have HIV testing,2018-09-17,CHANDIGARH,"News,City News,Chandigarh News,Civic Issues","CHANDIGARH: In an effort aimed at timely detection of HIV-infected drug addicts through proper screening and testing, the Punjab government has decided to open integrated counselling and testing centres at private drug de-addiction centres . The government plans to set up these under public-private partnership (PPP) mode.As per the data of National Health Profile-2018, which was released recently, there are 26,841 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV). The state has 12 antiretroviral therapy centres where HIV infected people are given treatment. There are around 84 de-addiction centres located in different parts of the states, of which 53 are licensed private centres. While most of the government drug de-addiction centres already have integrated counselling and testing centres, the private centres are functioning without this facility.Dr Manpreet Chhatwal, additional project director of Punjab State Aids Control Society, shared that the integrated counselling and testing centres will be opened in private drug de-addiction centres under PPP mode as defined by the National Aids Control Organisation for screening of HIV patients as well as for hepatitis-C. As per the guidelines framed by the health department, proper screening will be done by the staff posted in these centres for HIV and hepatitis-C by using testing kits, which will be provided by National Aids Control Organisation and National Health Mission.The government will sign an MoU with the private de-addiction centres for which the process will be started by the Punjab State AIDS Control Society. Any person found HIV-positive will be referred to the nearest antiretroviral therapy centres for further treatment and the list will be shared with the nearest government centres by private de-addiction centres every month. Anyone suffering from hepatitis-C will be referred to district civil hospital and government medical colleges for further treatment.In cases where integrated counselling and testing centres are not available in public health institutes, the existing staff, including laboratory technician\staff nurse will be imparted training by the Punjab State Aids Control Society and civil surgeons office for the screening of patients and necessary kits will also made available.Punjab health minister Brahm Mohindra said that timely detection would help in providing the required care and treatment to people infected with HIV and hepatitis-C. “We want to ensure that the facility of counselling and testing centres are available at all drug de-addiction centres,” said Mohindra."

Leopard: Eight-year-old mauled to death by leopard in Moradabad,2018-09-19,MORADABAD,"News,City News,Bareilly News","MORADABAD: An eight-year-old boy from Moradabad’s Balapur village under Thakurdwara sub division was mauled to death by a wild leopard at a sugarcane field.The incident occurred on Monday morning when victim Shiva, along with his uncle Kuldeep Singh, was collecting fodder for his cows. The leopard then suddenly grabbed Shiva by his neck and dragged it along to the cane field.Later, Singh called for help after which two of his brothers reached the spot. After spotting the leopard, they attacked the animal with a stick and took Shiva to a hospital.However, the doctors declared Shiva brought dead. Doctors said he suffered grievous injuries on his neck and head.“Shiva and I were collecting fodder for our cows when suddenly a leopard jumped over and grabbed him by his neck and dragged him to sugarcane filed. I raised an alarm, and my two brothers—Ajay Kumar and Raj Kumar—immediately came to the rescue. We found the leopard at a sugarcane field and attacked it with stick. For 15 minutes we struggled to rescue Shiva. Later, we took Shiva to a district hospital, where the doctors declared him brought dead,” Singh said.Angry with the boy’s death, villagers, along with the victim’s family, protested against the Moradabad administration and forest officials. Swayed by the protest, the officials announced Rs 15 lakh as compensation.Sub-divisional magistrate Veenta Singh said the forest officials have been told to catch the leopard immediately.“The compensation amount will be delivered soon to the family members of the boy. We are in constant touch with the forest officials, and will do our best to avert such kind of incidents in future. The higher authorities have instructed the forest officials to lay down an effective strategy to cage the leopard as soon as possible.”Giving out reasons behind such attack, district forest official Kanhiya Patel said, “In search of food and water the leopards move to human populated areas from jungle . They can easily hide themselves inside the sugarcane crops. Presently, the leopard is hiding at the village and residents have been asked to be alert until it is caught. We have installed cages, and hopefully it will get trapped soon.”"
‘No blood from gays’: Male donors to be asked about sex life,2018-09-26,MUMBAI,,"MUMBAI: A new and more exhaustive blood donor screening questionnaire will now require male donors to answer questions about their sexual behaviour and whether they have multiple partners. While a ban on gay men donating blood has existed in India for decades, this is the first time that the form spells out these questions in black and white.Blood banks in Mumbai recently received the updated format from the state arm of the National Blood Transfusion Council that, in October 2017, had revised its guidelines pertaining to selection of blood donors. The guidelines reiterate that gay and bisexual men, transgenders and female sex workers can never donate blood as they have a higher risk of contracting HIV and Hepatitis B and C.The ban also applies to individuals suffering from chronic illnesses such as cancer, organ failure, allergies and respiratory ailments.Staffers at the blood banks said the new questionnaire, designed on the lines of developed nations, has put them in a spot. The earlier format cursorily asked whether the donor had a reason to believe he or she may be infected by hepatitis, malaria, HIV or AIDS, or any venereal disease.The new questionnaire mandates blood collectors to ask if the donor has “multiple sex partners or engaged in male to male sexual activity”.Detailed donor profiling will not be a cakewalk though, say stakeholders. “It is going to be tricky for us, but it’s also essential to keep such patient history forms as truthful and scientific as possible. Such questions are asked in most developed countries,” a blood transfusion officer told TOI.Dr Shobini Rajan, in charge of blood safety at National Aids Control Organisation, said the new questionnaire merely intends to strengthen pre-donation screening as blood units are subjected to tests only after collection. “The Act is clear that donors cannot be at a high risk of contracting infections and donate blood too,” she said, adding that the SC verdict had no role to play here. “That’s a change in law. We have to see if it brings about any behavioural change,” she said.Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar Trust said there are issues of confidentiality that need to be addressed better. “Are gay men simply supposed to give away such intimate details? While such questions are necessary for screening, they also have to create an environment where a person feels comfortable to share,” he said, adding that banks much seek the help of gay community counsellors.He further said that world over the debate has long shifted from permanently prohibiting gay men from donating blood to 12-month exclusions, where they are prohibited for 12 months after sexual activity. “It’s time we begin such discussions here,” he said."
Diabetes surge a worry but can be rolled back,2018-09-27,"As a diabetologist and researcher who has been working on diabetes for over 40 years, I have seen my practice grow from a small clinic to a hospital chain with centres across the country. Nevertheless, I was amazed to see the results of a recent study published in Lancet Global Health indicating the scale of the problem today. The number of people with diabetes in India increased from 26 million in 1990 to 65 million in 2016, with the prevalence increasing from 5.5% to 7.7% over this period. The highest prevalence was seen in Tamil Nadu (13.1%) followed by Kerala, Delhi, Punjab, Goa and Karnataka.The state with the most individuals with diabetes, however, was Uttar Pradesh, a reflection of its huge population. Thus, there were 8.38 million people with diabetes in UP with Tamil Nadu being a close second with 7.17 million, despite having 1/4th the population of UP. The highest increase in diabetes rates was seen in the poorer states.In the 1970s, the prevalence of diabetes in cities like Chennai was 2%, while in rural areas, it was 0.5 to 1%. But today, almost a quarter of Chennai’s population has diabetes. At age 55, almost 40% of the population of Chennai has diabetes and another 35% has pre-diabetes which means that in older people, only a quarter of the population has normal glucose tolerance.The Lancet paper concludes that the major driver of the epidemic in India is increased body weight (obesity). Unhealthy diet and low physical activity also contribute, while the newer risk factors identified are tobacco and exposure to second-hand smoke (air pollution).Diabetes in India differs from that seen in the west, in that, even with lesser degrees of obesity, Indians are prone to type 2 diabetes. While the exact mechanisms are not known, it is believed that there could be inherent genetic (ethnic) susceptibility factors. Moreover, the high carbohydrate diet that we eat also contributes significantly. In South India, this is predominantly due to polished white rice consumption which leads to an increased demand on the pancreatic beta cells, eventually leading to their exhaustion and hence to diabetes. This, coupled with decreased physical activity, has been shown to be a major contributing factor.A worrisome trend is that diabetes is no longer a rich man’s disease and has moved to the middle income group and even the poor. Diabetes rates in urban slums and the rural poor are rising fast. The problem is that these are highly vulnerable populations as they are unable to afford treatment for diabetes. It is estimated that 25% to 35% of a poor person’s income can be taken up by treatment of diabetes.The increase in diabetes in rural India is also a problem because in many villages, specialized health care is not readily available. People with diabetes need an annual check-up of eyes, kidney, heart and feet apart from other tests. It is also important to make all essential drugs available across the country. A recent study by us showed that insulin is available only in 76% of pharmacies in India — its non-availability was mostly in rural areas, perhaps related to the lack of electricity and refrigerators to store it.Another worry is that diabetes is moving from older people to middle aged and young adults, and even to adolescents and children. As it takes only 15-20 years to develop complications of diabetes, when these children become young adults, they run the risk of developing eye, kidney, heart, nerve and other problems. If this happens to millions of people, it can be an economic disaster for the country. Diabetes has the potential to do to India what HIV did to countries in Africa.According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), in the next few years, India will overtake China and become the world diabetes capital. The estimated number of Indians with diabetes by 2045 is 134 million -- which I believe is a very conservative estimate. Luckily for us, it is eminently possible to prevent diabetes. In the Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program, we showed that by making the diet healthier by cutting down on carbohydrate and including more protein, fibre, healthy fats and green leafy vegetables as well as regular exercise, i.e. walking for 30 minutes at least five days a week, it was possible to prevent diabetes in almost a third of people with pre-diabetes. With the epidemic continuing to grow, governments, policymakers, NGOs and the public, along with the medical profession, must get together to stop diabetes in its tracks.

Newborn son contracts HIV infection from father: Study,2018-09-28,NEW YORK,News,"NEW YORK: In an unusual case, researchers have reported how a newborn baby of an HIV-negative mother got the infection from his father who was also suffering from chicken pox.Fluids leaking from skin blisters of the father was determined to be the source of the infection.""Transmission occurred during the seroconversion period when the father was unaware of the ( HIV ) infection and was likely accidental,"" said the study co-authored by Nuno Taveira of University of Lisbon, Portugal, and colleagues.Diagnosis of the child happened when he reached age 4.The results of genetic, phylogenetic, and serologic data analysis on both the father and son and the hypothesis for how the boy became infected were published in the journal AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses.Based on comparative analysis of the data from the father and the son, the researchers concluded that the virus was accidentally transmitted to the son during the first days of the child's life.During this time of seroconversion, the father was being treated for infection with varicella-zooster virus (chicken pox) and syphilis when he developed large vesicles all over his body that profusely leaked fluids.The high virus production early in HIV infection would have made the fluids leaking from the father's skin blisters highly infectious, the study said.These infectious fluids could have come in contact with the newborn child causing this atypical HIV transmission event.""This case shows how genetic, phylogenetic, and serological data can contribute for the forensic investigation of HIV transmission,"" the study added."
Social science institutes don't attract funds easily: Tiss director,2018-09-26,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: Social science institutes don't attract funding easily, be it from the government or the corporate sector, said professor Shalini Bharat, who officially took over as TISS director on Tuesday. ""People are investing in research park, innovation cells, but we don't see any funding coming our way...We do not even have enough seed funding to work on our ideas,"" she said.Bharat, who was the deputy director (academics) at TISS, was holding additional charge as the director for over six months, after S Parasuraman retired in February.Speaking about the challenges faced by the premier institute, Bharat said the financial situation is not so good and they would need support from various sources. ""We are reaching out to people. It is matter of converting all the good wishes to actual funds. Many have shown interest and we are getting money, but it is nowhere close to what we need."" The shortage of funds in social sciences' sector paints a worrying picture for institutes like TISS.TISS had competed for the Institutes of Eminence tag from the MHRD but lost out to other institutes despite having the highest NAAC rating in the country. It was granted grade-I autonomy status recently.""The challenge now is to consolidate what we already have and do quality research, and work with communities and disadvantaged groups... More importantly, we want to evaluate the impact of our work. We will have to see what more needs to be done and how,"" Bharat said.Though physical expansion of the campus is not on cards, she intends to start courses where there is a possibility of revenue generation. ""People are keen to have a degree from TISS. We will have to acc- ordingly design courses based on the need of the industry.""The new director is keen on bringing some stability across their campuses. ""Students have raised a few issues in the recent past, which are importa- nt. There have been some problems (referring to the recent protests over scholarships) but we have commenced work to augment our endowments and to get more scholarships and more fellowships for them. There is a shortage, but we are trying to raise funds and support many more students. It may not exactly match their demands, but we are making a sincere effort,"" said Bharat.For the last two years, UGC has been hinting at the closure of few centres, including the ones working on social exclusion and inclusive policies, women's studies and human rights . ""We are constantly in dialogue with the UGC and we are hoping for a positive outcome,"" she said. From research point of view, she said she would continue to work on her projects in the health sector, like studying the impact of counselling on health systems and self-testing for HIV"

State joins forces with private players to eliminate TB,2018-09-29,PANAJI,"News,City News,Goa News","PANAJI: Around 2000 TB cases are detected each year in Goa, the state tuberculosis officer and chief medical officer of the revised national tuberculosis control programme, Dr Maximiano De Sa said on Friday.Since a very small proportion of the cases detected in the private sector are not notified and brought to the notice of the government, he said it is high time that private and public sector join hands to eliminate TB in the state.“Goa has a strong private sector which is 50:50. Many TB patients prefer private doctors, as first point of contact, because of privacy issue. We need strong support from our colleagues in the private sector, in notifying such TB cases,” he stated during the state launch of Joint Effort to Eliminate TB (JEET) at Panaji.Notified patients will be offered drugs free of cost supplied by WHO qualified pharma companies which undergo stringent quality check mechanisms. Notified patients will also be provided with associated services like HIV testing, multi drug resistance testing, counseling and chemo prophylaxis he stated.While De Sa highlighted the problem of undiagnosed or inadequately diagnosed and treated TB, he said the emergence of a deadly form of the disease i.e drug resistant TB is a bigger worry. “TB spreads very easily because it is airborne and there is already a threat of this drug resistant TB spreading,” he stated.He also added that the government of India recently launched a social support scheme to help all TB patients by offering them Rs 500 each month for the entire duration of their treatment i.e 6-8 months and for multi drig resistant TB- 2 years. Around 300 patients in the state have availed of this scheme he stated.The JEET project aims for intensive engagement of private sector to achieve universal access to quality diagnosis and treatment for TB and help the nation in achieving The National Strategic Plan to eliminate TB by 2025."

However, police sources said that they suspect the money transaction could have taken place in lakhs. The businessman could be hiding the transaction details to avert questions of the source of income.The accused was identified as A Mahendran, 48, from Kavunji near Mannavanur in Kodaikanal, which is located 30 kms away from the town. N Vikram, the businessman hails from Chromepet in Chennai. He came in contact with the accused when he was searching for a property in Kodaikanal. Mahendran helped Vikram with information on properties available for sale.Mahendran contacted Vikram recently over phone and told him about the iridium vessel. He said he had got the vessel, which purportedly has medicinal effect, through his friends. Vikram showed interest on the vessel as the accused told him that one can be cured of diseases like HIV infection and cancer, if food prepared from the vessel is consumed over a period of time.They struck a deal and Vikram visited Kodaikanal on Sunday along with his friends.

Matrimony site for HIV-positive people launched at IIM-A,2018-08-22,AHMEDABAD,"News,City News,Ahmedabad News","AHMEDABAD: It’s Cupid for people with HIV . A website, launched at IIM-Ahmedabad (IIM-A) by Surat-based organizations Sri Rama Krishna (SRK) Group and Gujarat Sate Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (GSNP+), will connect persons with HIV/AIDS across the globe.An initiative of GSNP+, the website has financial support from SRK Knowledge Foundation and technical support from IIM-A. IIM-A director Errol D’Souza said the website represented a progressive step. He said that field surveys indicate that the number of people living with HIV is higher than official estimates.Daksha Patel, the founder of GSNP+, said that about 16 lakh people live with HIV in India. “In Gujarat, 68,000 persons regularly visit ART (antiretroviral therapy) centres,” she said.“The actual number — including those taking treatment at private centres —might be higher. With the rise in longevity thanks to modern treatment, there has been an increase in demand for matrimony services. However, this matrimony service works way differently from the standard ones.” GSNP has so far organised six major meetings for prospective brides and grooms living with HIV and has been instrumental in 245 weddings in about a decade. The registered members for matrimony are about 1,900.It was Rasik Bhuva’s case that became instrumental in starting the matrimony service and eventually the website for GSNP+. “I was diagnosed with HIV soon after my engagement. I was quick to break the relationship off citing health issues,” said Bhuva. “When I started counselling HIV patients, I met a girl from Navsari and we tied the knot.”He admitted that even today many prefer not to disclose their positive status to their close family members. “We have made it a norm to at least involve one senior family member from both sides to avoid any trouble later,” he said. “The problem is more acute in rural areas where we go to the patient’s home as bank or government officials to administer medicines.”"

Alarm: Biomed stockpile disposed with civic waste in Hyderabad,2018-08-27,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Hyderabad News,Civic Issues","HYDERABAD: Even as bio-medical waste in Hyderabad is increasing every year, efficient handling of toxic stockpile remains a challenge for healthcare facilities and Pollution Control Board (PCB).Environmental activists say that many healthcare centres that produce large quantities of bio-medical waste either dump it in open spaces or burn it at open dumpsites.Realising that these methods pose serious risks and can cause both health and environmental hazards, the Pollution Control Board (PCB) has indigenously developed eco-friendly ways to safely segregate and dispose all the hazardous waste.Segregation of waste in colour-coded paddle-operated covered bins is one of the most effective ways that PCB has introduced, and it also provides training to paramedical staff and waste handlers to segregate and discard all infectious, non-infectious, bio-degradable and re-cyclable material.N Raveendher, former environmental scientist with the Pollution Control Board said, “In most of the health care centres, the fault lies with hospital authorities and waste handlers. They simply do not follow the rules even after repeated warnings.”Dr P Surya, who runs a private clinic at Nagole says, “The main things that have to be disposed in clinics are syringes, as no amount of boiling can kill some viruses like HIV . A simple incinerator machine costing a few hundred rupees does the trick, but a majority of them just don’t use it.”The tip of the syringe is put into a slot in the incinerator which burns it off and then the glass body of the syringe is sterilised, then smashed and disposed of as regular municipal waste as it becomes harmless. However, a lot of the smaller private clinics as well as nursing homes are known to throw their needles along with regular waste.According to experts, the situation is mostly due to lack of awareness. A few healthcare centres have started segregating and incinerating their waste but there is still a long way to go."

All people living with HIV should be tested for Hepatitis B and C infections as well.""HIV, HBV, and HCV have similar routes of transmission. They spread by contact with infected body fluids such as blood, semen and vaginal fluid, or from a mother to her baby during pregnancy or delivery. Due to these shared routes of transmission, people at risk for HIV infection are also at risk for HBV or HCV infection. Of these, HIB is more infectious.""The signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis appear quickly and include fatigue, flu-like symptoms, dark urine, pale stool, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, and yellow skin and eyes, which may be signs of jaundice"
Rahul Gandhi reveals his plans for NHS-style healthcare system in India,2018-08-27,LONDON,"News,India News","LONDON: Congress president Rahul Gandhi has revealed ambitious plans to introduce an NHS-style state-funded universal healthcare system in India under a Congress government.Speaking to 200 doctors at the Royal Society of Medicine in London on Saturday, the Congress president said,“ the goal of universal healthcare in India” had finally become achievable.""The NHS offers free quality medical treatment at the point of delivery and is accessible to all in the UK, regardless of wealth.“Congress is trying to conceptualise how a universal healthcare system similar to the NHS can be built in India. The goal of universal healthcare is something we aspire to and is something we will achieve. I don’t think that goal was achievable 10 to 15 years ago because we didn’t have the money,” he told doctors from Guy’s and St Thomas’, King’s and Imperial.Dr K Sudhakar, who organised the healthcare symposium, confirmed to TOI on Monday: “We would like to do something like the NHS in India. We would like to understand what the right practices are and it needs to suit India’s affordability as we may not be able to spend what the NHS spends. It’s about affordability and scalability. We need to ensure the quality of healthcare and then there is no reason why anyone in India should need to use private institutions. Modicare is an eye-catching slogan that does not solve the problems,” he said.Congress plans to adopt the “best healthcare practises across the globe” and implement these in India “when Congress comes to power,” Sudhakar said.In the UK most patient contact happens in primary care (visiting the GP), unlike India where the majority of healthcare delivery happens within tertiary care (seeing consultants).Explaining why this is the case, Gandhi said: “The politics in India has not decentralised powers.”“If you look at the politics in England — I saw in Richmond the local government system and how the local decisions are taken by that council,” he told the doctors. “The Indian system concentrates power in the hands of the chief minister and prime minister. If you want an effective primary healthcare system, you have to have the local political structures governing that system so it is a question of devolution of power to the villages and to the urban areas. That’s a fight because there are forces that don’t want to devolve that power. You are not going to change the primary healthcare system unless you change who is implementing and running it and it has to be done at the local level.”Gandhi also told the healthcare professionals that India’s record on HIV and on generic medicines was “exceptional”.He agreed with a psychiatrist’s comment that more psychiatrists were needed in India, but he said the Indian system already has a parallel traditional system of “support structures that play that role that don’t necessarily look like psychiatrists, example yoga, meditation, when we go to temples, these are all ways of relieving pressure,” he said.“India has its own traditional system of coping, like joint families. There is another system and it’s quite a powerful. A lot of our philosophy and inward-looking nature is designed to solve this problem and it works.”Sudhakar is now setting up a committee with healthcare professionals from across the world to come up with suggestions on best healthcare practices for India. This will then be presented in a white paper."
LGBT: Gujarat: ‘Gay prince’ designs South Asia’s first LGBTQ academic module,2018-08-28,AHMEDABAD,"News,City News,Ahmedabad News,Schools & Colleges","AHMEDABAD: While the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer (LGBTQ)-rights movement in India is coming into its own, the world’s first openly gay prince and LGBTQ rights activist, Manvendra Singh Gohil, has pioneered South Asia’s first academic module on LGBTQ community. Titled, ‘Proclivity of Gender: Socio-legal approach to LGBTQ Community’, the compulsory course was launched at the Ahmedabad-based Karnavati University on Monday and will be taken by undergraduate students of Law and Liberal Studies at the varsity.Over 60 participants ranging from higher-secondary school students to PhD scholars from across the country will also participate in the course. “The idea behind the course is to foster inclusive education and greater social acceptance towards the third gender. It will include topics such as the history of LGBTQ rights movement in India and how it began, provide international references to LGBTQ-rights movements, legal rights, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) – a review petition on which is being heard by the Supreme Court, and socio-cultural aspects of the community,” said Gohil.Mental and physical health – including HIV, medical and ageing-related issues, will also be covered in the course, he said. “Through this course, we will present facts about the community, that are backed by evidence and reasoning to the students to make them understand various aspects of the LGBT community.”Lack of acceptance at various levels including parents, family, friends and social circles is an issue that often gives rise to discrimination – which at times takes violent and abusive forms – against LGBTQ persons, say experts.“Discrimination is so rampant against LGBTQ people in the country that they are denied access to basic facilities including healthcare and the right to property, among several others. Educating students about the LGBTQ community will help sensitize them to the invisible sexual minority. A few years down the line when these participants may encounter friends, colleagues, acquaintances or even their own children being queer, they will treat them as equals, which is seldom seen at this point. Education therefore will help bridge this gap,” said Prof Shrut Brahmbhatt, convener of the course at the varsity.Anahita Sarabhai, founder, QueerAbad – an online platform for Ahmedabad’s LGBTQ community, also echoed a similar view and said, “Raising uncomfortable issues and initiating conversations around them is also one of the key roles of education, which such a course will fulfil.”"
"Medical insurance may soon cover dental, infertility fixes",2018-08-29,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: In what may mean more inclusive healthcare policies for patients, the insurance regulator has removed around 10 items, including procedures such as dental, stem cell , infertility and psychiatric treatment, from the list of “optional cover” for health insurance.The Insurance and Regulatory Authority of India (IRDAI) in a notification Monday said in a partial modification of guidelines on standardisation of health insurance business some items have been deleted from the list of “items for which optional cover may be offered by insurers”.These include dental treatment that does not require hospitalisation but is widely availed of, hormone replacement therapy, infertility, subfertility, assisted conception procedures, obesity treatment, psychiatric and psychosomatic procedures, corrective surgery for refractive error , treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, any expense for retro virus or suffering from HIV and AIDS, stem cell implantation, etc.Industry executives say the move to include more medical procedures in insurance is aimed at correcting an anomaly. “Earlier these items were optional and, therefore, were not covered by most insurers. Now, insurers can design products to include these items,” an industry analyst and researcher said.The insurance regulator may soon provide more clarity by issuing a separate order making it binding on companies to include these procedures in their plans, according to a source. Insurance penetration in India remains low.Merely 43 crore individuals, or 34% of the population, was covered under any health insurance in the year 2016-17, according to the National Health Profile 2018, compiled by the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence.Despite the spread of private coverage, growth in health insurance is mainly driven by government-funded schemes or social insurance. Private sector coverage is largely limited to urban households. Even among those who have some coverage, 79% are under public insurance companies.While these companies have a higher share of coverage and premium for all types of health insurance policies, except family floater policies, including individual policies, private-sector schemes lead to high out-ofpocket expenditure.According to NHP 2018 data, the claims ratio by private insurers was 67%, whereas by public insurance companies 120% during 2016-17.In 2017, 70% of the total expenditure on health in India was paid out of pocket, according to WHO’s health financing profile."

If they did not want us here, then they should have given us a special room or sent us away,” she said. The patient has been admitted at GMC in the past but this is the first time the family says such a board was affixed.“The staff did not think about the repercussions on the family. The ward sister was actually fixing the board near the patient’s head, but later put it at the foot of the bed. Were instructions given by the doctor to put the board? When the other patients ask the nurses about the board, won’t they reveal the health status?” she asked.“Even the few people who are coming to visit the patient will stop once they come to know about the health status. Neighbours are also coming to visit and are asking about the board. It’s a big shame for us. I’m going mad,” she said.The board was removed on Tuesday evening after a non-governmental organisation, Human Touch, working to end discrimination and provide care and support to people living with HIV raised the issue with the hospital authorities.Dean of Goa Medical College Dr Pradeep Naik said circulars were issued in the past asking the staff members to avoid any such terminology.“We have given strict instructions to all wards not to engage in any discriminatory behaviour against patients. From the preliminary report which I have received, it is not clear who put up the board. I have sought a detailed report by Wednesday. We will repeat the circular that we had issued earlier. This will never happen again,” he told TOI.“Universal precautions are necessary, but should not be displayed publicly on the patient’s bed,” CEO of Human Touch Foundation Peter Borges said.“This is not an isolated case. Such incidents will lead to more stigma and discrimination for those living with HIV. Such attitude of those working in medical space is unbecoming and will create hardships for those trying to access healthcare services in public hospitals. We will never be able to end the stigma if it exists in medical settings,” Borges said."
Goa back to square one on AIDS discrimination: Doctor,2018-08-30,PANAJI,"News,City News,Goa News,Civic Issues","PANAJI: Dr Ishwar Gilada, who fought for the release of the first Goan HIV+ patient , Dominic D’Souza, after he was ostracised and subjected to forced isolation back in the late 1980s, says the discrimination continues several decades later.“The state is back to square one,” rued Gilada, president of the Aids Society of India and one of the first physicians in the country to fight against the discrimination of people living with HIV.“Dominic was isolated, humiliated and discriminated against, 25 years ago. The only difference is in the current case, the patient wasn’t incarcerated. The HIV and AIDS Prevention Act, 2017 should be applied and an FIR must be filed,” he told TOI, referring to the incident of discrimination at GMC on Tuesday.Dominic tested positive in 1989 and was detained in isolation at Mapusa TB Sanatorium. His friends approached Gilada who came down to Goa from Mumbai. He organized rallies in Dominic’s village in Parra and filed a writ petition through his mother, a retired nurse, to challenge the detention under provisions of Goa Public Health (Amendment) Act. He met legislators and was asked to give a presentation in the assembly to bring some clarity about the virus and its effects.“Then speaker Dayanand Narvekar invited me to give a presentation at the assembly. He adjourned the session to allow me to explain to MLAs how HIV is transmitted, how it is not, and how it was counterproductive to keep Dominic behind bars,” Gilada reminisced. “I told them citizens wouldn’t come forward to get themselves tested if they were treated like this. I also urged them to repeal the Goa Public Health Amendment Act, which they later did,” he also said. The legislation made it mandatory to keep HIV-infected persons in isolation.He got Mumbai-based lawyer Anand Grover to fight the case in the high court and after 64 days of forced isolation, Dominic was released.“The case paved the way for a sustained fight against discrimination and human rights violations of patients and culminated into the passage of the recent HIV Aids Act,” says Gilada."
Discrimination of HIV+ patient: NGO files complaint,2018-08-30,PANAJI,"News,City News,Goa News,Schools & Colleges","PANAJI: Human touch foundation, a voluntary organisation, has complained to health minister Vishwajit Rane about the discriminatory treatment meted out to an HIV+ patient at Goa Medical College GMC ), Bambolim.The complaint states that the sign affixed to the patient’s bed displayed ‘insensitivity and stigma’ towards the patient. The letter, written by the organisation’s founder and CEO Peter Borges, states that “this is completely unbecoming, inhuman and unexpected in the healthcare setting. This will not only increase stigma and discrimination , but also deter thousands of people living with HIV from accessing treatment”.Borges said people, including those with HIV, expect from GMC healthcare services that are decent, respectful and free of prejudice and stigma. The plaint has also been sent to the project director of Goa state aids control society, GMC dean Dr Pradeep Naik, its medical superintendent, Dr Shivanand Bandekar and director of health services, Dr Sanjeev Dalvi.The complaint attached TOI’s August 29 report headlined ‘GMC reveals identity of HIV+ man, kin in trauma’. The story, which this newspaper carried on its frontpage, reported that GMC had affixed a board on the hospital bed of an HIV+ patient, thus discriminating against the patient and causing much trauma to the family."
HIV-positive woman in labour denied admission at UP govt hospital,2018-08-30,BIJNOR,"News,City News,Meerut News","BIJNOR: The district hospital in Bijnor allegedly refused to conduct caesarean section of an HIV-positive woman in labour when she was brought there on Wednesday. Despite repeated pleas to the chief medical superintendent (CMS), the woman was referred to a higher centre.After the woman was brought to the district hospital, tests indicated she was HIV-positive. After this, hospital staff allegedly refused to conduct the surgery. The woman and her family members pleaded to the staff, but they did not relent.“I am in unbearable pain. I requested the CMS to give me admission, but she refused. I am from a poor family and can’t afford expensive treatment,” said the woman, a resident of Nagina area in Bijnor, at the premises of the district hospital. She was taken to Meerut Medical College in critical condition and is still in labour at the time of filing of this report.“The woman is a native of Mumbai and married a Nagina man a few years ago. Her husband works in Delhi and they are financially deprived. The husband is not HIV-positive,” said a district hospital staff with access to the woman’s medical record.Hospital authorities on the other hand cited lack of adequate facilities as the reason for turning the woman away. CMS Dr Abha Verma said, “We have only one operation theatre and the mattress on which the operation is conducted needs to be destroyed after surgery on an AIDS patient. Besides, all surgical equipment also gets contaminated. The sterilisation process takes at least four days, which means the operation theatre needs to be shut down for that period. Our hospital has to conduct 7-8 deliveries per day. It is mandatory to carry out ceasarean section if the woman is HIV-positive. It is done for the safety of the newborn. Meerut Medical College was suitable for it, therefore we had to refer her there.”"
Bhubaneswar Rainbow Pride Walk: Bhubaneswar Pride Walk raise issues of LGBTQIA+ community,2018-09-01,BHUBANESWAR,"News,City News,Bhubaneswar News,Civic Issues","BHUBANESWAR: Carrying rainbow flags and wearing glitters on their cheeks, hundreds of lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgenders, intersex, queer and allies (LGBTIQA+) walked during the 7th Rainbow Pride Walk held in Bhubaneswar on Saturday.The main objective of the pride walk was to demand equal rights, social acceptance and abolition of section 377 . Through the walk, they also raised their voice against humiliation and struggle they experience.“The response was overwhelming. Many professionals and students of leading colleges have joined the walk and supported the community, which indicated that people’s mind-set, response and acceptance level towards the community is changing,” said Meera Parida, a leading transgender activist.The participants said, they look forward to a positive response from the Supreme Court by reading down section 377 to exclude consensual sexual acts between adults.“The verdict would free the community from the criminality tag and enable them to access the rights of basic services as a citizen of India,” said Sadhan Mishra, another LGBTQIA+ activist.After 2014’s landmark judgement of Supreme Court to give legal sanction to LGBTQ community, the state government has taken some initiatives like included them in BPL category and provide ration cards to some transgenders, which they claim is very little.“Mainstreaming of the persons of the community is the major challenge. We want to create awareness among the parents of persons of the community to accept their children and come forward to fight for their rights. Government should provide reservations in jobs and in politics as well,” said Mishra.Prior to the pride walk several outreach events like queer poetry and storytelling and queer film screening sessions were held where they discussed the struggles of young LGBTQ individuals in colleges who often have to face isolation, discrimination at work places and colleges, and shaming because of their sexuality.“Our motive was to explore how religious texts, historical accounts and cultural and anthropological books talk about homosexuality, so that we understand the trajectory of social progress of the LGBTQ community. We also intended on understanding the position of different religions on this, which is often a major dilemma that the community individuals face. I believe, discussions and readings help us update our thinking by backing them up with facts and truth,” said Bijaya Biswal, one of the organisers of the events.The Bhubaneswar Pride Walk was co-organized by The Parichay Collective, a LGBQ Community of Odisha, Sakha, an indigenous trans-community which has been supported by the State government since a few years, and SAATHII a voluntary organisation working for the cause of HIV-AIDS."
"Despite meds, Maharashtra’s HIV+ kids fight a crippling battle",2018-09-03,SOLAPUR,"News,City News,Pune News,Civic Issues","SOLAPUR: Sumana will turn 18 next year, but she looks 10, is four-feet-tall and weighs 30kg. The HIV-positive girl is hearing impaired and her mental ability is that of a child half her age. Like her, at least 60% of the 110 inmates at Solapur’s Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, the state’s oldest institution caring for children with HIV , suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss . TOI found that the prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over 30% have stymied mental development.AIDS-related deaths may have dropped by 54% in India over a decade, but most children in rural areas living on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are barely surviving, afflicted by physical and mental deficiencies. The reason: the national programme focuses on medicines instead of a comprehensive medical, nutritional and psychosocial model. For the nearly three lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors, mostly underpaid, and overburdened with administrative work. A fourth of India’s 60,000-odd children taking ART for HIV live in Maharashtra . With no adequate support, the state recently learned that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have quietly dropped out.Sumana looks like a 10-year-old though she’s a teenager 11 months shy of 18. Four feet tall and with body weight of 30kg, she is at least 25kg underweight and significantly short for her age. Her mental ability is of a child half her age and she is hearing impaired.At Solapur’s Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, one of Maharashtra’s oldest institutions caring for children living with HIV, cases like Sumana’s are not an exception. At least 60% of the 110 children here suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. The prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over a third have stymied mental development. Besides physical, prevalence of mental health problems such as depression is alarmingly high.AIDS-related deaths have dropped by 54% and new infections by 66% in India over a decade, but children like Sumana are a testimony to the gaping deficit in the national programme that focuses on drugs instead of a holistic medical, nutritional and psychosocial model that a complex disease such as HIV warrants. A little over a quarter of the 60,000 such children are in Maharashtra.An otherwise spirited child, Sumant gets drowsy and irritable after taking medicines. “I get severe stomach-ache, dizziness, headache and diarrhoea,'' he says, describing his plight after taking the daily dose of antiretroviral therapy (ART) medicines. Born with the virus, these children need to take two to six capsules daily. For additional infections such as tuberculosis, the pill count could run into double digits. Their very survival depends on following this regimen, but the six-year-old Sumant is among 17 children at the Palawi home who refuse to continue with ART .“Children go through hell in spite of ART. There is no denying the dramatic shift in HIV care today, but what about those who got the disease at the turn of the century and have spent a lifetime taking medicines. We know little or nothing about what the virus or ART does to each child?” said Palawi's founder, 65-year-old Mangaltai Shah. She says most children in Palawi grapple with problems ranging from skin rashes, oral and vaginal yeast infections, pus accumulation in ears, hearing and vision problems to life-threatening infections such as TB. “So when medicines meant to heal start giving additional trouble, they find it easier to discard.” Moreover, she adds, at Rs 25 per child per day institutions like Palawi neither have adequate funds nor support from government hospitals to tackle the unique health problems of each child.Sumant is supposed to receive intensive counselling from the local ART centre till his adherence improves, but Shah says the three doctors and four counsellors that cater to 300 HIV patients daily at Solapur Civil Hospital barely have the time to look up. For nearly 3 lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors. Another Palawi resident, four-year-old Khusboo, suffered hearing loss after recurrent ear infections. The diagnosis didn't come from the ART centre, but from her teacher at Palawi’s in-house Gyan Mandir school, who noticed Khusboo was oblivious to classroom activities.The institution was compelled to start its own school in 2014—a ground-plus-one structure next to the orphanage on Pandharpur’s outskirts—as children are denied admission in regular schools the moment Palawi is mentioned. But it’s a blessing in disguise for these children who struggle to sit through more than one or two classes without dozing off. “A regular school wouldn’t understand or probably tolerate it,” Patil says. Palawi which has been home to 250 HIV-positive children since 2001, has lost 40 to the disease. AIDS claims an average of 2,500 lives in Maharashtra annually; how many are children is not known. The state recently discovered that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have dropped out. Here too, paediatric percentage is unclear. On paper, 16,000 children in Maharashtra are on treatment.Coping is equally challenging for children in the community, who having lost one or both parents to the virus, face vulnerabilities starting from poor access to healthcare and government entitlements to education and nutrition.Now 17, Palghar native Sachin has been on ART since he was three. He lost his mother at birth and father last December to HIV. He admits to skipping his daily 10-pill regimen. He dropped out of school due to his condition. “The pain would begin after the morning pills. I would cry in class and be compelled to lie down,” said Sachin who can't keep a job either as the medicines make him “drowsy and tired”. At four-feet and grossly underweight at 35kg, Sachin typifies the wasting and stunting associated with HIV.HIV is a neurotropic virus that not just attacks the immune system but practically affects every organ, resulting in damage to nerve tissues, cognitive development, physical growth, and at the same time causing learning difficulties, speech and language problems. Experts say it’s crucial to monitor toxicity and provide 360-degree healthcare. Dr Ira Shah, an expert in paediatric HIV, says it’s not enough to tell children to take medicines lifelong. “These are toxic drugs given at a much younger age. It is necessary to monitor bone health or metabolic acidosis before the children become intolerant,” she said. In one of her published papers, she wrote about three children who died of neurological complications caused by HIV despite their viral load being suppressed with drugs.National Aids Control Organisation deputy director Dr R S Gupta admits little is known about how children cope with ART. But he underlines the fact that “they live longer because of the medicines and the average life expectancy now exceeds 20.” There are side-effects, but “what is important is they are alive”. Ironically, Sumant, Khusboo, Sachin are Indian HIV programme's success stories even though they are not thriving but merely surviving.(Names of all patients have been changed)"
"On medicines for 16 years, youth stresses on family support",2018-09-03,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: Chinmay Modi was nine when his mother’s sudden illness changed all their lives overnight. Besides his mother, Chinmay and his father too tested positive for HIV , considered a death sentence in 2002.A single doctor consultation cost the family Rs 50,000 in Surat and the medicines another few extra thousands. Still at the end of every visit, Modi and his parents would return home dejected and feeling closer to death. Soon they decided to give up the expensive treatment and prepared to meet their end.They went on without medicines for close to a year till India rolled out the national programme under which patients were given free antiretroviral medicines. “We were among the first 200 people in a Surat hospital to get that,” says Modi, crediting the government initiative that is presently keeping over a million alive.Taking 15 pills was not easy for a nine-year-old. Modi, now 25, says he has been successfully taking ART for 16 years and could only do it because he had the support of a family. “The need of an emotional and social support in HIV treatment is not appreciated enough. No child wants to eat medicines daily when it causes diarrhoea and stomach pain. I could sustain the treatment as I come from a well-off family where I got adequate nutrition and push to have medicines everyday. Still opportunistic infections like herpes afflicted me,” says the member of National Coalition of People living with HIV India (NCPI+).Modi says that while India did well in providing medicines, its efforts halted just there. “Even today, it is challenging for a child to eat medicines daily, hiding from friends and under the looming fear of getting caught,” he says. He, therefore, emphasizes on the role of a family, kin or a counsellor. “The child needs to know why he is eating medicines. In the absence of this awareness, they have low adherence levels, which in turn gives rise to resistance,"" he says. The government must find out why so many children are fast shifting from first to second line of drugs.“There is no quality counselling. Not more than ten minutes is spared explaining them,” says Modi adding that now when children are living till adolescence and adulthood, the quality of their lives must be a part of the HIV narrative in the country."

Why Narasinghpur sees most accident deaths every year,2018-09-04,GURUGRAM,"News,City News,Gurgaon News","GURUGRAM: Next time when you are driving on the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway , be extra cautious when you reach Narsinghpur— one of the most dangerous crash-prone stretches — as your car could plough into pedestrians crossing the road. The village, which is located on either side of the NH-8, has seen the highest number of fatal accidents in the district over the past several years, mostly involving people crossing the highway.On Sunday evening, one more pedestrian died after being hit by a speeding car while crossing the median at Narsinghpur. According to the FIR filed at the Sector 37 police station, he was trying to climb the median grille in a bid to cross to the other flank of the road when the car hit him. The pedestrian was thrown into the air before landing a few metres away and died on the spot, police said.Though official figures put the number of accidents along the highway in Narsinghpur to six in 2016 and eight the year before, the villagers say not less than 40-50 people fall prey to hit-and-run accidents every year. Narsinghpur houses predominantly members of the Gujjar community and a significant population of migrant labourers from Bengal and Bihar.Sanjiv Bedi, a resident of Narsinghpur, said, “Authorities have failed to stop two-wheelers from taking the foot-over bridge (FoB). Owing to this, pedestrians find it tough to use the footbridge. Immediate measures should be taken so that the FoB is reserved only for pedestrians and not motorists.”The NHAI, when contacted, has said maintenance of the expressway is the responsibility of Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL), the concessionaire. Moreover, pedestrians are not allowed to cross the expressway, and will have to take the FoB) to cross the road.Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI (Gurgaon), said, “One can cross the expressway only by using FoBs or pedestarian underpasses. Median grilles have been installed to prevent pedestrians from crossing the road. This is an enforcement problem. This has to be prevented by MCEPL with or without the help of the police. People need to follow the rules to avert these accidents.”MCEPL is responsible for upkeep of roads, street lights, drains and CCTV cameras from Delhi Cantonment area till Kherki-Daula, according to the concessionaire. “We’re doing our work properly,” said MCEPL CEO S Raghuraman.Col Subhash Yadav, general manager, Skylark Securitas Pvt Ltd, the toll operator that has been given the responsibility of the entire stretch, said, “We have ensured that all medians are closed. It is the responsibility of pedestrians not to use the highway. On a highway, vehicles go at a high speed. NHAI has built a FoB why don’t the people use it?”Last month, the entire stretch has seen only one accident, which was also not fatal.People cross the highway by breaching the rules to reach hospitals, schools, ATMs and post office, and t avail other utilities. “Yes, the entire stretch has four points where pedestrians breach the median. Time and again, we have put barbed wires and repaired them too. However, pedestrians cut these wires to cross over to Narsinghpur,” Yadav said.Experts suggested that new alternative methods should be enforced to prevent pedestrian deaths. Professor Sewa Ram of the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) said the authorities concerned should set up level-crossings if people were not willing to use the FoB. “Level-crossings should be set up at busy intersections. These are road crossings, and most of them have traffic signals and either barriers or gates, which shut the road when cars are approaching. This system can have alarms also to warn pedestrians on approaching vehicles,” said Sewa Ram."

NEW DELHI: Senior BJP leader, Subramanian Swamy , said that homosexuality is a genetic disorder in response to the Supreme Court's judgement decriminalising gay sex on Thursday.Swamy admitted that people are entitled to their privacy but said that homosexuality is a disorder similar to someone having six fingers.""Of course what happens in someone's private life should not be of anyone's concern, neither they should be punished. It is basically a genetic disorder, like someone having six fingers. Medical research must be done to rectify it,""Swami was quoted as saying by the news agency ANI.The senior BJP leader further commented that legalising gay sex can lead to increase in HIV cases in India.""It is the American game. Soon there will be gay bars here where homosexuals can go. HIV will spread. So, after looking at the consequences I hope the next government will move a 7 judge bench to set aside this 5 judge bench order,"" said Swamy.On his social media account, the former union minister criticised the Supreme Court for not criminalising sex with animals.On the other hand, the young BJP MP from North Mumbai, Poonam Mahajan, celebrating the SC's verdict called it a victory of equality.Mahajan is national president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, youth wing of BJP. She has been at the forefront of BJP's millennium voter program aimed at first time voters in the country participating in 2019 general elections.On Thursday the Supreme Court ruled consensual intercourse among adult homosexuals or heterosexuals in private space does not harm public decency or morality.In a landmark verdict, Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice A M Khanwilkar, who wrote the main 166-page judgement, held that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code had become an ""odious weapon"" to harass the LGBT community which was made ""societal pariah"" by subjecting them to discrimination and unequal treatment.The CJI held that Section 377 in its present form violated Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution that deals with freedom of speech and expression.(with inputs from agency)"

However, a mixed set of reactions was received from a bunch of citizens in the city.Several residents of the city shared their enthusiasm for a law that endows its people with equality in rights. On the other hand, it was deemed as immoral by some.City filmmaker Kundan Sad said he felt that we are opening up to the right things now. “Everybody has the right to choose to live with whoever they want. I feel happy about the verdict,” he said.Cinemontage president Ram Tayade said he has never restrained himself from screening movies related to the LGBT issue. “It was only last Sunday when we showcased the film ‘Father and Sons’, which is related to this topic. “Our members too have been mature in their understanding and it’s good that equal rights have been given to all,” he says.RJ Milind, creative head at Radio Orange, also welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision and said he was happy for the LGBT community.Some people may be inclined to homosexuality or towards being a transgender, said Dr Yugal Rayalu, HoD of vocational education at Dharampeth Science College.“Homosexuality isn’t a crime. Religious interpretation defined man-woman relationship for the purpose of procreation. But in the whole act of sexual union, nature has added a sense of pleasure. The religiosity of sexuality has to end, and religion has to guide people to be happy,” he said.“As a citizen, I’m very happy,” said Ruta Dharmadhikari, principal of LAD College. “I respect the Supreme Court for this just decision. I feel every human being has the right to live the way they want to. I welcome the verdict on humanitarian grounds,” she added.“I’m very conservative,” said Vilasini Nair, director of Nair Sons. She said, “We should follow the steps of our ancestors and not be too selfish. We are harming and losing out the culture of the country by supporting the idea of homosexuality.”“The psychology of citizens will get affected due to this verdict, and so will procreation. We have been endowed with great heritage, and we should not let it go for a toss,” she added.State IMA president Dr YS Deshpande’s opinion differed from Supreme Court’s verdict. “Medically, there can be a rise in sexual disorders like HIV/AIDS as they are common in homosexual individuals. Due to Section 377, there was some restrain in having multiple relations, and giving it a legal support will only worsen the problem,” he said, adding that he also objected to the verdict on grounds of morality."

"With no disclosure norms, most HIV+ kids learn about ailment after parent’s death",2018-09-04,SOLAPUR,"News,City News,Pune News","SOLAPUR: Throughout her childhood, 14-year-old Mona would overhear terms such as ‘HIV’ and ‘AIDS’ uttered in hushed tones at her Solapur house. The mystery ended two years ago when her mother succumbed to AIDS following a ten-year battle.Her bedridden father, also afflicted by the virus, broke the news to her just a day later. “It’s a germ in our blood that will stay with us forever. It has not spared you either,” says Mona, recalling her father’s words. The revelation, she vividly remembers, was followed by a directive to keep it a secret. More than the disease, it was the secrecy that instilled a deep sense of shame.Similarly, Pandharpur native Sundari (13) barely had time to cope with her father’s death when she was told about her HIV status. That was the first time her grandfather told her that it was AIDS that killed her parents. Unable to bear the ill-treatment meted out to her by the extended family, the grandfather put her in an orphanage, where she presently lives.Studies have underlined the criticality of disclosure—telling someone about their HIV status—in fighting the disease and how, when done under tragic circumstances and without counselling, it can damage the way an HIV-infected child or an adolescent view themselves for the rest of their lives. The lack of a holistic framework in India has left parents, caregivers and institutions grappling to find the right approach. Several children discover the ailment accidentally or at the time of losing a parent; many come to know when they are being discriminated against, or worse, after they have been sexually abused.The complex questions of ‘how to tell’ and ‘when to tell’ is simply passed over at Pune-based Manavya , one of the oldest homes in Maharashtra to care for HIV positive children. The caretakers never let out the “secret” even as they teach every child how to take medicines and fight the disease. “If they have questions about HIV, we answer them scientifically,” said Shirish Lawate, trustee of Manavya. Children as young as five start questioning their daily medications. “We tell them it’s to kill the jantu (organism) inside their body,” says Sushma Apte, one of the coordinators.Visits to hospitals and ART centres seem to be one of the common ways children discover their HIV status. Fifteen-year-old Sushila says, “I figured I had HIV by looking at posters at Solapur Civil Hospital. But it took me a while to understand there are ways other than physical relationships to get HIV,” she says. The teenager is from Palawi in Pandharpur , a residential institution run by Mangaltai Shah and her daughter Dimple Ghadge that provides shelter to 110 HIV children. Ghadge says counselling at state-run ART centres is perfunctory. “That’s perhaps the reason why mental health issues, particularly depression, mood swings and anger is rampant among them,” says Ghadge.Chinmayi Modi, a member of the National Coalition of People living with HIV India (NCPI+), adds that the incidence of suicides among HIV-affected youth is high but there is no verifiable data.At the Bandra-based CCDT, for in-house residents older than 10-12 years, the disclosure is done gradually keeping the child’s maturity in mind. It’s when families are involved, says programme director Poonam DSouza, that it becomes challenging. “All parents want to delay it till their children are in late teens,” she says. “But we discourage late disclosures since children at that age start having relationships and should be aware of the risks of unsafe sex,” she adds. Brahmadev from Vihaan, an NGO working for HIV, says it’s common for children to blame parents, run away from home and stop taking medicines.Unlike practices worldwide, where a lot of thought goes into disclosing a child’s HIV status, no structure exists here, says Shabana Patel, president of Network of Maharashtra People with HIV (NMP+). ""The first counselling when a child starts ART is crucial and should last for a minimum of 45 minutes. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen even for 5 minutes,"" says Patel. In Maharashtra, there is one counsellor for every 300 HIV patients. Parimal Singh, who heads Maharashtra State Aids Control Society, said a methodology is being drawn up to ensure those who have adherence issues don't miss out on quality counselling.Mumbai’s Sion Hospital has developed some tools for this purpose. Counsellor Laxman Jamkhandi uses storytelling to educate his young patients. White cells vital to the immune system assume the role of good soldiers that need the aid of weapons like ART drugs and nutrition to kill the black demon virus. “A superhero story never fails to get the attention of children,"" he says. ""With better ART, children are surviving for decades, so it's better their body and mind starts accepting it early.”"

At 17, I came in touch with a queer group and started working actively for queer rights and health.Setting up the regio nal office of Naz Foundation International in Lucknow in October 2000, Jafar began work on HIV intervention.""The government and police did not approve of this. Since January 2001, the local intelligence started making inquiries and by June over 140 inquiries had been made to harass us,"" said Jafar.On July 6, 2001, Jafar's worker was arrested for distributing condoms at Charbagh and on July 7, three others including Jafar were arrested from his Dalibagh office.""Two from Naz Foundation and two from Bharosa Trust were put behind bars. We were tortured and not given drinking water for eight days. We drank the water supplied in the toilet.

Subramaniam Swamy lashed out at Thursday's SC order +

NEW DELHI: For all its debates on 'minority rights', the political class has skirted any discussion on the LGBTQ minority, wary of a backlash from their conservative support base. In 2013, when the Supreme Court heard the appeal against the Delhi high court ruling, the then additional solicitor general P P Malhotra, representing the UPA government, strongly opposed decriminalising Section 377 , saying that would be ""immoral, unethical and abhorrent"" for society.Discomfited by criticism of its stand, the UPA government drafted then attorney general GE Vahanvati, who said there was no error in the HC order and left it to the SC to take a view. After the, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi expressed disappointment with the verdict. The Centre filed a review in early 2014, which was rejected.Even earlier, the contradictions within the UPA government were evident when the home ministry's affidavit in the Delhi HC said homosexuality could not be morally condoned while the health ministry said Section 377 was an obstruction in the fight against HIV/AIDS.The Modi government decided to leave the decision on whether Section 377 should be decriminalised to the SC, carefully limiting its implicit ""no objection"" to same-sex relations between consenting adults. It made it clear that it did not want the court to consider issues like adoption, inheritance and marriage.Watch: Historic verdict - What is Section 377?While the government took its stand, BJP kept a low profile on the issue, with its spokespersons avoiding comment. The view in the party seemed to be that with the Centre having taken a stand intended to facilitate decriminalisation, there was no need to agitate conservative opinion further. The caution and confusion that has marked the response of successive governments is a fair indicator of the social taboos working across support bases of various parties.Among mainstream politicians, finance minister Arun Jaitley, Congress leaders P Chidambaram and Shashi Tharoor and BJD MP Tathagatha Satpathy are rarereversing the Delhi HC order. There have been a few others, like BJP MP from Raipur Ramesh Bais who, as head of a parliamentary panel, sought to expand transgenders rights.But largely, the reactions of the political class have been hostile. BJP MPsaying homosexuality was a ""genetic flaw"" like having six fingers. RJD leader Lalu Prasad opposed the 2009 Delhi HC order, saying gay sex was an obscene act. Dissident BJP leader Yashwant Sinha had once suggested, as retaliation to the cavity search of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade in the US, that American diplomats in India with samesex partners be arrested.Vishwa Hindu Parishad has described homosexuality as an ""imported disease"". The silence of most parties indicated a concern that conservative opinion, and widespread prejudice, would be critical of any endorsement of the gay community."

UNITED NATIONS: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Thursday welcomed the landmark ruling by the Supreme Court to annul part of the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code that criminalises consensual gay sex.""Discrimination and prejudice are always ‘irrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary"", as Chief Justice Misra says. I welcome today's decision by India's highest court #LoveWins,"" Guterres tweeted, quoting Chief Justice Dipak Misra 's remarks.A five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Misra unanimously held Thursday that the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) community possess the same constitutional rights as other citizens of the country.The bench termed sexual orientation as a ""biological phenomenon"" and ""natural"" and held that any discrimination on this ground was violative of the fundamental rights. The top court decriminalised part of the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code that criminalises consensual gay sex, saying it was irrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary.UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), also welcomed the historic decision, saying criminalization of consensual same-sex sexual relations is a violation of human rights and legitimizes prejudice and violence against LGBTI people.""Today is a day of gay pride , a day of celebration, a day when respect and dignity was finally restored in India for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people,"" said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of UNAIDS.""I applaud the brave activists, civil society organisations and community groups that have fought long and hard for this injustice to be reversed.""UNAIDS said that criminalization hinders people from accessing and using HIV prevention, testing and treatment services and increases their risk of acquiring HIV.In India, HIV prevalence among gay men and other men who have sex with men is 2.7% and among transgender people is 3.1%, compared to the national HIV prevalence among all adults of just 0.26%. Around three out of ten gay men and four out of ten transgender people in India who are living with HIV do not know their HIV status. Many LGBTI people living with HIV do not have access to HIV treatment, the UN agency said.It added that gay men account for 18 per cent of all new HIV infections worldwide.UNAIDS urged countries to ensure the full respect of the human rights of all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, through repealing laws that prohibit sex between consenting adults in private, enforcing laws to protect people from violence and discrimination, addressing homophobia and transphobia and ensuring that crucial health services are made available.""I hope this decision sets the trend and is followed by similar decisions in other countries that remove unjust laws criminalizing homosexuality,"" Sidibe said.In June 2016, United Nations Member States committed in the Political Declaration on Ending AIDS to promote laws and policies that ensure the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for children, adolescents and young people, particularly those living with, at risk of and affected by HIV, so as to eliminate the stigma and discrimination that they face."

Rajasthan police have also hired an agency for creating these messages, which are then released under the supervision of ADG (Crime).Despite the fact that their message on Jasprit Bumrah , the pacer of Indian cricket team conceding a no ball in a match against Pakistan, went awry, the police is using everything from festivals to movies to spread their message.The most recent one was posted by Rajasthan police on Friday on twitter asking people to wear helmets, saying, “#Bollywood inspires us all. Don’t bring that inspiration on roads and try to be Khataron Ke Khiladi. We will come knocking like Singham and say Aata Majhi Satakali,” (the famous one-liner of the protagonist played by Ajay Devgun in the movie Singham).“See, the idea is to reach out to the youngsters who get carried away by various things. I think social networking has become a powerful tool to give out a loud and clear message on how people should behave while driving, why youngsters should keep themselves away from drugs and other things,” said Pankaj Singh , additional director general (Crime), talking to TOI on Friday.Moreover, police are also sharing messages asking people to be strong enough to avoid becoming victims of cybercrime . “We have said that people sometimes make mistakes like sharing passwords, clicking on unsecured links and revealing personal information. We are communicating with people, as in this day and age, a 4G network and smartphones are accessible to all,” he added.While the momo challenge was making news for leading people to commit suicide, the police posted, “Momos are always welcome on dinner table, but not on your phone.”On the ill-effects of drugs, the police had posted, “Did you know — 11 million people worldwide inject drugs, of which 1.3 million have HIV , 5.5 million have Hepatitis C and 1 million have both the diseases’’.In some of the messages, police are also using an accompanying video to make the message more impactful, like they did on Janmashtami, “We have said that like Krishna always stood resolute to protect his friends from demons in disguise, we are also vigilant and determined to protect our kid friends from demons. We make sure our kids are safe and protected,” he added.The police first gets the rough draft of these messages before they are posted, and finally after the approval and changes, these messages are published on social networking platforms like twitter. Rajasthan police has 13,000 followers on twitter and the number is increasing.Cops get creative:“You don’t need a shot of Heroin to be a hero. Be a real HERO by saying a BIG NO to drugs.

Such prisoners are put-up in separate cell blocks. While there are 1,263 inmates in central prison currently, around 70 are in special prison for women and 75 in sub-jails. Three medical officers are deputed to central prison and two for women’s prison, while doctors from the respective primary health centres inspect the inmates in sub-jails.Trichy programme manager of district aids prevention and control unit (DAPCU), Dr S Martin Manivannan , said that the main goal behind the initiative is to spread awareness about HIV and TB among prisoners and curb the spread of diseases within the prison and after their release. “We would give sensitisation programmes to inmates on possibilities on spread of HIV. Apart from this, tests would be done for those with HIV symptoms so that they are given timely treatment,” he said.Deputy director of medical services, TB control, Dr S Savithri told TOI that sputum samples of all the inmates with TB symptoms would be collected over the next few days and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) would be performed to detect TB."
'SC verdict decriminalising consensual gay sex beginning of a new challenge to end discrimination',2018-09-08,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court judgement decriminalising consensual gay sex is not the end of the fight but the beginning of a new challenge to eradicate discrimination, various bodies have said, stressing the need for working on changing social norms that ""ghettoise"" individuals based on regressive perceptions of social acceptability and morality.Lauding the judgement, the Population Foundation of India (PFI) said it is a victory for LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) individuals and those who have stood with them in a long and hard battle against an ""archaic"" provision of law, which infringes on an individual's bodily autonomy, sexual rights and identity.The judgement demonstrates the value of collective and persistent community activism, as with persons living with HIV/AIDS, who continue to collectively fight against stigmatisation worldwide to gain equal status on individual rights, it said.""The SC verdict is heartening for PFI as a ray of hope on ensuring freedom of choice, equal rights and access to sexual and reproductive health services without prejudice or discrimination for other marginalised communities,"" the body said.PFI underlined that progressive changes to law are a necessary precondition, but not sufficient to ensure equal rights in practice.The body said there is a need to work on changing social norms that stigmatise or ghettoise individuals based on regressive perceptions of social acceptability and morality.""We call upon all sections of society to ensure implementation of the law in its true spirit. The judgement needs to be followed through with policies that address the barriers faced by LGBTQ individuals, such as sensitising the medical fraternity, doing away with 'conversion therapies', seeking help on sexual and mental health services, redressal for workplace discrimination and broader legal rights,"" it said.Others maintained that the judgement is not end of the fight but beginning of a new challenge to eradicate discrimination. Manvendra Singh Gohil, Goodwill Ambassador of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, said deep-rooted discrimination against the LGBTQ community in Indian society has shattered lives of LGBTQ people.""In fact, the saddest day in my life was when, I was discriminated and denied rights to ancestral property due to my decision to reveal my sexual orientation to the world.""This decision by SC is not end of the fight but beginning of new challenge to eradicate discrimination. The honourable judges created history by demonstrating to the world all citizens are equal in India,"" Gohil said.Dr V Sam Prasad, Country Programme Director of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, said the Supreme Court scrapped Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), thereby removing the age-old clout of prejudice against the LGBT communities.""This is a historic and the most progressive liberal judgement guaranteeing the equality and protection of rights of these communities and thus ending the stigma prevailing for centuries in India.""However, the battle is far from over as one needs to closely observe the reactions of our diverse society divided by numerous ideologies, belief systems, cultures, and socio-political pressures,"" Prasad said.The Supreme Court earlier this week struck down parts of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised consensual unnatural sex, saying it violates the right to equality."
Forward-looking 377 order holds lessons for the world,2018-09-09,"Supporters of equality and justice around the world celebrated the decision of the Supreme Court of India affirming the fundamental rights, dignity and equality of LGBTQ people in India.

It is hard to imagine a US Supreme Court majority affirming so clearly that “The Constitution protects the fluidities of sexual experience. It leaves it to consenting adults to find fulfilment in their relationships, in a diversity of cultures, among plural ways of life and in infinite shades of love and longing.”This victory is the achievement of a diverse, brilliant Indian LGBTQ movement. It is a testament to so many people’s courage and decades of effort to build intellectual, cultural, legal and political space, to forge positive identities despite stigmatisation, to support each other, to create and engage families, to build alliances, and to sacrifice a great deal to bring change. The long struggle suggests that the promise of justice expressed in this decision will require persistent, broad-based, inclusive action to be realised.Court decisions declare what is lawful, but extra-judicial organising, education and political engagement will be needed to extend rights and realise equality for all LGBTQ people, not just a privileged few.

The International Commission of Jurists outlined in its 2017 report titled ‘Unnatural Offences: Obstacles to Justice in India Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity,’ that reforms in police procedures, courtrooms, and the entire legal profession are urgently needed to combat bias, misinformation, violence and police abuse.This decision underscores the truth that changing law and policy is tied to changing culture, behaviour and attitudes. Ground-breaking work by Indian legal scholars, writers and think tanks to analyse homosexuality from an Indian cultural and constitutional context set a strong foundation for the SC verdict. Changing cultural norms requires greater support for research, as well as for media, educational, artistic and community outreach, and other creative projects.Alliances across civil society are essential to the project of cultural, policy and attitudinal change. Indeed, every advance for LGBTQ rights around the world has been built on a foundation of activist leaderships forging hard-fought, and at times uneasy, alliances across social movements and civil society: Transgender, caste, HIV/AIDS, women, progressive legal reform, business sector groups, civil rights, racial justice, progressive faith, workers, and minority rights groups, to name just some.The Supreme Court’s powerful articulation of the difference between social morality and constitutional morality may well be tested in the months to come. Reactionary forces manipulate fear and misinformation about sexuality and gender identity to build a political base, as movements in Russia and the US can attest. Gains in LGBTQ rights are followed by backlash, often fomented by a specific, globally connected network of anti-LGBTQ organisations and donors. Some of these groups claim the mantle of religious expression, but are not representative of religious traditions; pro-LGBTQ voices exist in every religious tradition. In this context, the SC’s statement that “identity is equivalent to divinity” is a profound affirmation of sexual and gender identity.Finally, the court’s ruling suggests what experience reveals — equal rights and access to justice will require government action. And ensuring that this action is unbiased requires mobilisation of a political infrastructure. The US movement still lacks political power, but through education, advocacy, and engagement with all parties especially at the local (municipal) and state level, it has increased political support significantly. Non-LGBTQ allies have been especially important in the process of educating public officials, as have parents and family members. Still, the political challenges to LGBTQ equality remain significant.The SC offered a clear vision of full citizenship for LGBTQ people. Under the continued leadership of India’s activists, lawyers and movements, this promise of justice will ultimately be fulfilled.(The writer is a US-based LGBTQ rights activist)"
"section 377: RIP Prejudice: Now, they tell their story with pride",2018-09-07,"I was in Class 11 when I realised I was gay, but it took me three years to understand my orientation. About five years ago, I came out to my sister as my parents are no more. She took me to a psychiatrist who subjected me to electroshock therapy. I had to undergo three sessions — the first one lasted 20 minutes and I was in severe pain. I told my sister I don’t want to undergo “treatment” but they took me again after a week, sedated me and gave me a shock again, for a longer period. I had a final session after another week, and the doctor declared that I was “normal”.I am still gay. My sister is married and thinks that I am bisexual, and that it is a phase of life that will pass, and that someday I will marry a girl. I’ve had a boyfriend for a year and a half. Since he is still studying, he hasn’t yet come out, but we do plan to get married and hopefully now, it will happen sooner. Now that the law has changed, other changes will follow.In India, when a law changes, the mindset of people gradually changes. The community now needs more understanding than acceptance. Personally, I can go to my sister and say that I am gay, I have a boyfriend and I am not a criminal. I have equal rights like any other Indian citizen.- As told to Priya M MenonWhen people say ‘life in the shadows’, it is not an accurate description of what a person from the LGBTQ community experiences. What we experience is a life of sheer terror and fear. At every turn, one is faced with revealing the truth and wanting to live honestly with oneself. I am fortunate to have had family and friends who were supportive. But I know I am in a minuscule minority to enjoy the privilege of being open and yet loved and respected.The judgment on 377 will change lives. It was always my mission to battle 377 not for myself but for the youth and future generations. This judgment is historic not only for India but India’s progressive stance in the world. The people of the world will look at India in a new light. Something we should all celebrate for our country.It touched my heart when the judges stated that the country apologise for the pain suffered by LGBTQ and our families. I did not expect an apology. Nor did one expect the judges to put out the words like “I am what I am”. To quote a song that is an anthem for the LGBTQ community is heartening.Today the community can sing that anthem with pride, dignity and in the inclusivity of equal human rights for all Indians.Yes, finally. What I feel right now cannot be classified as happy or sad. I’m mostly relieved. A huge burden has been lifted from our shoulders. I am out as a gay person and I’m not worried for myself but I know of everyday stories of suicide, of youngsters running away from home, being beaten and blackmailed. Boys were forced to marry girls. Now we’ll be rid of these pressures gradually. People used to be scared of going to the police, but now they’ll be able to muster the courage to file a complaint if they face harassment.Earlier, whenever people used to wish me on Independence Day, I would reply ‘I’m still a criminal in my own country’.After living through many Independence Days, I’ll now scream that I too am free.I founded an NGO, Sarathi, 12 years ago, and believed that someday this will come true. Discussions about sexuality have now begun in houses and I’ve got calls from siblings of gay individuals asking how they can support their brother or sister. The fight has just begun. Social acceptance will come with time. If one has the right to marry, people will be bound in legal relationships and this will in turn reduce the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.- As told to Abha GoradiaI met my partner at a queer film festival in Mumbai in 2016. We sat next to each other and our arms touched. It was electrifying.I wondered if I was looking at an apparition or a human being, he was so gorgeous. We talked through the film. I was wearing a shawl and I asked if he was feeling cold. He wasn’t but of course he said that he was. So, we shared the shawl.We’re from different universes but love has brought us together. It’s challenging because he is 20 years younger than me and closeted — even his family doesn’t know — whereas I’m “super” out. I came out to my family in 2004 and was one of the lucky ones because my family accepted it without batting an eyelid. I came out very dramatically. My mom knew but I hadn’t told my dad. I was organising an LGBTQ film festival and the BBC wrote about it and put it on the front page of their website. So, I called my dad and said, “The BBC says I’m gay so it must be true because it’s the BBC.”I’m hopeful that Section 377 going away will liberate the LGBTQ community to love more freely and confidently. My partner and I would love to get married — even though in our minds we already are — and have it be recognised in India. Decriminalisation and equality are very different. There’s a long journey ahead before our love is considered equal.- As told to Nergish SunavalaIt was September 17, 2014, my 24th birthday. I had decided to finally tell my family about my sexual orientation. I had been dreading the moment as mine is a traditional family where men only marry women. But I had to tell them the truth about who I am. “What gift do you want, Ankit,” my mother asked as soon as I woke up. This is the moment, I thought to myself. I switched on my phone and showed them an episode from Aamir Khan’s TV show where he interviews a gay person. The idea was to make them understand that not all males like females and vice versa. They watched the videos, my family seemed OK, so I told them I am one such person. There was a few minutes’ silence. Then they said I should never talk about it again. That was the last I heard from them on the topic.Initially, they thought I was trying to avoid marriage. Then they realised I wasn’t lying and began efforts to “heal” me. They took me to pujaris and tantriks and psychiatrists. One psychiatrist tried to counsel them that I was medically fit, but they wouldn’t listen.I was always skinny as a child and classmates would tease me about being effeminate. When I was older, I realised I am gay. I knew I was not wrong and that it was society that was unaware. It has been difficult, living without talking about it.I work for the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation as a store sub-inspector. This is a historic day and a freeing judgment.I now have a new life to look forward to. I am in love. He is from Maharashtra. Maybe we can get married now.- As told to Syed Intishab AliIt’s always difficult to come out in a homophobic nation, especially since you are brought up with the same notion of hating and attacking someone who isn’t like you. It’s been a real uphill climb and I’ve lost several friends and family members. The ones who stuck with me mean the world to me. My mom is as woke as the millennials.I’ve been out to my friends since I was 19. At 22, I came out publicly at a comedy open mic and I haven’t looked back. I am one of India’s few professional comedians who talks openly about being gay in India.While I was aware that the law does not stop me from existing as a gay man, my partner and I have to constantly double check if every window and every door is tightly shut before we can hug properly or kiss each other. The law was twisted and used by homophobes to just shun the queer community.The scrapping of Section 377 will give others the confidence to embrace their identity. This life of dual identities can turn toxic and has led people down the road of addiction, self-harm and anxiety. No human should be scared to make love as they want to.

As the American rock band Starship proclaimed in their song, all I’d like to say is: ‘Nothing’s gonna stop us now’.- As told to Mohua DasI identify as a queer woman. ‘Queer’ is an umbrella term, which encompasses all identities within the spectrum. When I was about 14 years old, I realised that I appreciate the female form though I didn’t know what I identified as. Then J K Rowling (author of the Harry Potter series) said she always considered the character of Dumbledore gay. That had such a huge impact on me and I decided to explore my identity.I have been an activist for six years but have never come out to my parents. It is implied in the house. My mother keeps all the press cuttings in which I am referred to as a queer woman. But as the term ‘queer’ is ambiguous, my parents don’t think too much about it. I have spoken to them about the stigma and discrimination faced by the LGBT community and the violation of human rights. I consider myself privileged as I come from an urban, educated, upper middle class family.I have not had to face stigma and discrimination, but my relationships have always been hidden. The SC judgment has not yet sunk in, though I know it will change the lives of many. Hopefully it will help me talk to my parents. I hope to be able to talk openly to my younger cousins, nephews and nieces. I hope the SC judgment will help more queer women come out. Then, there are larger issues of being independent, financially and emotionally.- As told to Priya M Menon"
September 6 will go down in history as the day India became more equal: Elton John,2018-09-09,"Last week, as India’s Supreme Court was weighing the repeal of Section 377 of India’s penal code, we read a story about Aditya Das, who traveled six hours by bus to attend the first gay pride parade ever held in Bhubaneswar.After marching through the streets, waving rainbow flags and hearing cheers of support, Das said, “I felt I had reached heaven.”As two openly gay men, we understand that feeling. We know what life can be like for those whose love is demonized. And we know firsthand how acceptance—not just by friends and family, but by the government—has changed our lives, and the lives of countless others. In 2014, twenty-one years after we first met, and shortly after same-sex marriage became legal in England, we celebrated our wedding day. We reached heaven—with our two sons watching and the law on our side at long last. Our love was recognized, our family dignified, our humanity affirmed.Still, our travels around the world soberly remind us that we’re the lucky ones. We’ve visited many countries where homosexuality remains criminalized. We’ve seen the horrible consequences of legalized discrimination, both on individuals and on entire nations.That is why we commend the Supreme Court for its remarkable decision to repeal the colonial-era Section 377. September 6 will go down in history—a day when India became more equal, a day when 18% of the world’s LGBT population was told, in the words of Justice Indu Malhotra, that they are “not an aberration but a variation.”And we congratulate the plaintiffs and activists who sacrificed so much, for so long, to get to this moment. They, too, belong to history.Of course, we know that progress is seldom a straight line. We saw it in the United States with Proposition 8, a ballot initiative that banned gay marriages in California less than six months after they were legalized. And you experienced it with Section 377, which re-criminalized homosexuality after Delhi’s High Court ruled the ban unconstitutional.We know, too, that changes in law don’t necessarily equate to changes of heart. While this is a momentous shift for the world’s second most populous country, it doesn’t mean that people’s minds or lives will be altered overnight. We still have important work to do. But we are confident that, with this decision, India is on the path to permanent, positive change.Repealing 377 wasn’t just the moral thing to do. It was also the smart thing to do. The World Bank estimated in 2014 that homophobia costs India $31 billion a year in “lower educational achievement, loss of labor productivity, and the added costs of providing health care to LGBT people who are poor, stressed, suicidal or HIV-positive.” And that was four years ago—consider how that figure has likely risen since then. Acceptance is a precursor to opportunity, and India’s people and economy will prosper as a result of this historic repeal.Of course, repeal will also improve the health of your people. During the legal fight over Section 377, opponents falsely claimed that legalizing homosexuality would increase the spread of HIV/AIDS. On the contrary, studies suggest that criminalizing homosexuality actually fuels HIV epidemics, while tolerance for the LGBT community lowers a country’s HIV rate. Now, LGBT Indians will be able to escape a cycle of stigma and discrimination that dissuades far too many from educating themselves about prevention and accessing life-saving treatment.In its decision on Section 377, the Supreme Court justices noted that the Indian Constitution is not a “collection of mere dead letters.” In a similar vein, India’s LGBT community is hardly a collection of mere numbers or statistics. They are sons like Aditya Das. They are mothers and uncles and sisters and grandchildren, who know as well as we do that there is no substitute for equality. And while there is still important work to be done, this week, equality is the law of the land.

Since how long are you working in the field for LGBTQ rights?A. It’s been decade. Our main projects are with the government for creating awareness and provide the members educational facilities. Unfortunately, a majority of them don’t come out in the open fearing social stigma. Our focus is on transgenders and we work to bring them into the mainstream by inspiring them to take up education. Here too, there are two types: First, those who are from well-to-do families and accepted by their members. Some of them are highly qualified and one is a soon-to-be ophthalmologist. The second type is called ‘hijada (eunuchs)’ who are found in trains and at marriages. Their families didn’t accept them. They formed a separate group and have different lifestyle. They’re basically migratory and it’s very difficult to pin them down. They go out in morning and come back only in the evening. Yet, we’re trying our best to educate them.Q. What prompted a change of heart in the top judiciary?A. The fight started long back but got teeth after NGO Naz Foundation filed a case in the Supreme Court. In 2013, when its plea was rejected, there were only a few with the petitioner. Five years down the line, many individuals who’re from the LGBTQ community joined them along with their parents, suggesting a growing acceptance. Later, the Psychiatric Society of India also came out in support, dismissing the notion that getting attracted towards the same sex is a mental disorder. The entire media supported us wholeheartedly, which may have led to change in perception. In five years, even the judges have changed and they have adapted with today’s reality. All this may have prompted them to deliver the historic verdict.Q. How will it benefit the LGBTQ society?A. Earlier, our members were branded as criminals and humiliated, disrespected and abused. We were under immense pressure from family members as well not to disclose our sexual preferences. Some of us were even forced to marry normal individuals, which then led to ruining of both partners’ lives. In family courts across the country, couples have complained about partners. This is because partners in a majority of these cases prefer same sex partners. LGBTQ members feared job loss, faced trauma of ragging and were subjected to various jokes and torture. With this judgment, the LGBTQ members can live without any fear of being put behind bars. There would be no longer a sense of criminality among them. A similar judgment delivered in 2014 regarding right of privacy and granting citizenship to transgenders also significantly helped in our fight to get equal rights.Q. Many are now demanding even marriage and adoption rights be given to LGBTQs.A. Of course, it should be. It’s in fact allowed in many developed nations. Why can’t two adults live together? It’s not always that LGBTQ members come together for physical relations; we also need emotional support and companionship. We are human beings too and need a partner, and there’s nothing wrong if they’re from the same sex. If marriage rights are granted to us, we will not keep changing partners. The risk of diseases like HIV and AIDS would minimize. Secondly, it will also address problems of skewed sex ratio in the country where males outnumber females. By granting adoption rights, we would be able to help orphans by providing them educational and healthcare facilities.Q. There’s an apprehension that SC verdict would encourage sexual crimes against children.A. Certainly not, because LGBTQ members are just like normal humans and there is a big difference between them and paedophiles. The society needs to clear this misconception. Of course, we oppose sexual acts with minors and animals. But it’s not necessary that LGBTQ members would involve in such crimes; the only thing is they have different orientation, which was unacceptable in the traditional society till the SC’s verdict."
Four of 10 HIV+ newborns may miss timely treatment: Study,2018-09-10,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: Four out of 10 HIV-positive newborns in the city could be missing out on timely treatment as their parents fail to return for a confirmatory diagnosis . Failure to detect and treat HIV early may not just cause irreversible neurological damages , but also prove fatal for babies.Doctors at the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital recently discovered the worrying trend while analyzing data of 1,410 babies who were tested for HIV between 2015 and 2018 at the reference laboratory in Kasturba Hospital. At six weeks of birth, infants born to HIV-infected mothers are subjected to the first test, which if positive, is repeated immediately. This second test assumes great significance as the child is immediately started on antiretroviral therapy (ART), if this report too comes positive.The study showed that merely 61% of parents returned for the second confirmatory test. “We were surprised to see that so many parents are missing out on the second visit, thereby delaying the child’s treatment,” said Dr Jayanthi Shastri, who heads the molecular lab at Kasturba that receives samples from 36 HIV testing and counselling centres across the city. The laboratory also gets dried blood spot samples from Gujarat, Goa and Madhya Pradesh. “Such a delay is unfortunate as the advances in ART assure that children with HIV escape the serious neurological damages,” she said.Nair hospital’s Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre has found migration to be one of the biggest reasons. “In 70% of these cases, parents are migrants, who come here for child delivery and return to their hometowns. In a small percentage, it’s also the lack of understanding about the seriousness of HIV,” said Medha Deorukhkar, a counsellor at the centre. Around 46% of children were lost to follow-up, the analysis found.The national protocol warrants that babies be followed up to 18 months as antibodies from mother could give out false positivity in tests carried out before that. In fact, regular follow-ups and counselling are crucial not just for HIV-positive babies, but also for negative ones. While India data is scarce, it has been found that babies who have escaped contracting the virus during birth may still get it through breastfeeding. “Counselling is crucial as mothers may not comprehend the harm of switching between breast milk to formula milk,” said a doctor from Sion hospital’s paediatric centre of excellence for HIV. “Bottle feeds cause ulceration on the gut wall, which makes it conducive for the virus to enter the baby’s bloodstream.”Dr Shikala Acharya, assistant project director at Mumbai District Aids Control Society, said while mother-to-child transmission has dropped to less than 0.2%, tracking remains a challenge. In 2017-18, of around 460 deliveries in HIV-positive women, four babies tested positive. She said in families where the couple has not informed extended family, pursuing them to return for testing of the child becomes difficult.But Dr Anju Seth, director of paediatrics at Delhi’s Lady Hardinge Medical College, said it’s worth the effort as virus suppression is crucial here. “The first three years of a child’s life is when maximum growth happens. If the virus is not controlled, damages like stunting of height, weight and developmental milestones could be permanent.”"
Aadhaar helps identify road accident victim,2018-09-10,AHMEDABAD,"News,City News,Ahmedabad News","AHMEDABAD: It was an aadhaar card which helped residents to identify an accident victim who was crushed by a speeding car in the BRT corridor near Cadila Bridge in Isanpur on Sunday. The vehicle sped away after the accident with no one noticing the registration number. Harsha Purohit (48) was returning back home in the evening when she was hit by the car.Social worker Harshad Patel said iron barricade of the BRT corridor at the entrance is broken and many cross the corridor from that spot.“In the last one month, there have been five fatal accidents in the corridor in which speeding vehicles have hit pedestrians and two-wheeler drivers. Immediate repairs are required to avert such accidents,” said Patel.According to police sources, Purohit had parked her two-wheeler on the side of the road and was crossing the corridor on foot for some work on the opposite side of the road.“She was in the middle of the road when the speeding car dashed into her and flung her about 20 feet away. She sustained serious head injuries. We found her aadhaar card from the purse and informed her son about the tragic incident. He rushed to the spot and took her to a nearby hospital but she died on the way,” added a local resident.Police have registered a case of causing death due to rash driving and driving in the dedicated BRT corridor against the unknown car driver. “We have gathered CCTV footage of the accident and will identify the accused soon,” added a senior police official."
Health ministry implements HIV AIDS Act 2017: All you need to know,2018-09-11,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: The HIV AIDS (prevention and control) Act 2017 was implementated September 10 onwards, announced the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Tuesday.Rajya Sabha passed the bill in March that criminalises discrimination against patients suffering Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a condition caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) , which attacks and weakens the body’s immune system. Here is all you need to know about the act:* The bill is a milestone because it empowers a person living with HIV to report discrimination meted out against them in fields of employment, health care services, educational services, public facilities, property rights, holding public office, and insurance.* The Act penalises ""propagation of hatred"" against the protected person where a violator could be punished with a minimum jail term of three months to a maximum of two years and can be fined up to one lakh rupees.* The Act makes Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) a legal right for all HIV/AIDS patients. It has also adopted ""test and treat"" policy which means any person testing positive will be entitled for free treatment by the state and central government. Earlier, this was restricted by a CD4 count rate.* It also provides for confidentiality of HIV-related information and makes it necessary to get informed consent for undertaking HIV tests, medical treatment and research.* The law makes it mandatory for state governments to appoint an Ombudsman to inquire into complaints related to the violation of the Act and the provision of health care services.* If a person or an institution fails to comply with any order given by the Ombudsman within the stipulated period of time, they could be fined a maximum of Rs 10,000. A continuous failure could lead to an additional fine of up to Rs 5000 every day until the they comply.* The new legislation has provisions to safeguard the property rights of HIV positive people. Every HIV infected person below the age of 18 years has the right to reside in a shared household and enjoy the facilities of the household.* The Bill was initially introduced in Parliament by the UPA government, the amendments to the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2014 were revived by the Narendra Modi government in July last year.* The total number of people living with HIV in India is estimated at 21.17 lakhs, whereas around 86000 new HIV infections were reported in 2015, showing 66% decline in new infections from 2000. In 2015 around 68000 people died of AIDS-related causes nationally."
"At Delhi mall, transgenders say with pride they’re Born This Way",2018-09-12,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Delhi News","NEW DELHI: Days after Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code , which condemned LGBTQ citizens to humiliation and denial, was read down by the Supreme Court, the transgender community came together in strength and solidarity on Tuesday at Delhi’s Select Citywalk for the annual Hijra Habba . Organised by the HIV/AIDS Alliance India , the event, whose theme this year was ‘Born This Way’, brings together transgender advocates, international agencies and health organisations to present their perspectives, with song and dance and much good cheer.“We are the only sexual minority that is visible to the naked eye,” said Laxmi Narayan Tripathi , a prominent activist and head of the first transgender religious akhara. While hijras and transgender groups once had important roles in Indian society, they are yet to fully realise their freedoms. They are cast out of familial structures and political decision-making, leaving Tamanna Keni, 26, an activist from Thane, to rue, “We used to be the ‘mahalon ki zeenat’ (pride of the palaces) in Mughal times and the Maratha durbars had a place for us, but now we are left behind.”A survey of the National Human Rights Commission has established that 92% of the transgender community are economically marginalised. They rely on begging and sex work, and frequently face discrimination, even violence. A full 98% of transgender persons live apart from their families, so have for support their chosen gurus (‘the person your heart goes out to’, as Tamanna described the relationship) and their peers. This gives them a sense of community, but also sharpens their isolation from wider society.The Hijra Habba, in that sense, is an attempt to connect the community within itself and with others. Tuesday’s event started with a flash mob by the group Harmless Hugs. Many visitors were intrigued enough to stay and listen. “I had only heard myths, or seen hijras at ceremonies like weddings or births. I was just curious,” admitted Puneet Kumar, a 24-year-old MNC executive. He clapped enthusiastically at drag queen (also Mr Gay India 2014) Rani Kohinoor’s versions of ‘Ambar sariya’ and ‘I will survive’ almost as if responding to the emcee’s exhortation: “Iss function mein taaliyon ki kami nahi honi chahiye.”The Indian state recognises gender-variant identities in public documents, and many states like Tamil Nadu have dedicated transgender welfare programmes. The Supreme Court’s groundbreaking Nalsa judgment in 2014 made a basis for self-identified gender identity — the fact that you know the gender you identify with, irrespective of medical diagnosis, and that the law must give you your full due as a citizen. A transgender rights bill is pending in Parliament.Officials from agencies like the HIV/AIDS Alliance, National AIDS Control Organisation, USAID and UNAIDS spoke of “being in this together”. Cricketer Gautam Gambhir too expressed his support, congratulating everyone on the dilution of Section 377.Activist Gauri Sawant, one of those who had moved the Supreme Court on behalf of the transgender community, spoke of giving back to society and how one could invest care and attention on others. Sawant, who works in an initiative called ‘Nani ka Ghar’ for the children of sex workers, said her own sense of family was “Mere chele mere bachche hain”. She explained, “Motherhood is a behaviour, it doesn’t mean giving birth to a baby.”An exhibition at the event introduced visitors to the transgender community, what it means to identify as a woman or man, the behaviours one learns by wearing a bindi or holding up a false moustache. It introduced people to prominent trans persons and to cultural references like Bahuchara Mata, a patron deity of the hijra community. To walk through the space is to understand what it means to be born in the way we all are but being force-fitted into a rigid gender identity."
"‘A gay man need not wear a sari or makeup, he can be manly’",2018-09-12,"They all were in their classrooms when the Supreme Court finally struck down Section 377 last week. When they found out about the verdict, their reactions ranged from excitement and happiness to tears. Some could not believe that they were witnessing the historic judgement, while others were trying to process the fact that they were not ‘criminals’ in the eyes of the law anymore. Debolina Dey, assistant professor from Ramjas College , Arpit Bhalla from Indira Gandhi National Open University , Debottam Saha from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, and Abhishek Vats from Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Management Studies share with us their struggles, how they came out to their parents, and their hopes of social acceptance after the verdict.Arpit Bhalla,who is currently pursuing a diploma in HIV Prevention and Family Health Care from IGNOU, has faced his share of struggles while growing up. “It was an everyday story, starting from school. People would mock me with words like chhakka, hijra and sixer because of my femininity. When I moved from Haryana to Delhi to join Hansraj College, I thought Delhi would be inclusive, but it was not. After a struggle of two years, I founded the Gender Equality Cell in my college. In the beginning, the administration wasn’t very supportive of it. But then I did my research, got in touch with all the queer groups working in campus, spoke to activists, and then presented it all to the administration. Initially, when the cell started, we were put under the Women’s Development Cell of the college. But we gave it our best and organised several events, and then the college administration believed in us. Now, we work independently. When we started, there were hardly any takers for the posts in the cell, but by the end of the year, around 15 members had come out to me and that was very special,” he says.Arpit Bhalla, former Hansraj student, currently pursuing diploma from IGNOUArpit tells us that he came out to his family three months ago, but there has been no discussion with them about the SC verdict. He says, “It was a very confusing moment when the judgement came out. I was shocked, excited and happy. But till now, there has been no reaction from my family. I came out to them after my pictures from the pride parade came out – it was like mental torture. My family was already aware of my identity because they had seen my pictures everywhere, but one night, I just went to them, and said, ‘I don’t belong to the masculine image that people expect. I belong in the complete spectrum and I want to explore it’. They were adamant and ignorant but things are changing. I know they will take time to understand. Haryana is a more conservative place so things will change gradually.”Debolina Dey, assistant professor of English at Ramjas College, identifies as queer. Originally from Siliguri, she has studied in one of the premier girls’ colleges of DU. She shares with us, “I went to an all-girls’ convent school, and I remember, back in 1996, when I was 11, my best friend and I were actually talking about getting married to each other in jest. The first thing she said was, ‘Debo, we are going to end up in jail!’ That’s my first association with the idea of two girls wanting to be with each other, even as, 22 years later, I was telling my friend that the sense of criminality was so ingrained with the idea of same sex love. Now, I feel vindicated,” she says.Debolina Dey, Assistant Professor, Ramjas CollegeTalking about the change that she has seen in DU from the time when she graduated, Debolina says, “I teach in a fairly privileged college of DU. The college has a very heterogeneous population. As far as the Humanities are concerned, I think the attitude is more liberal. But it is still a very elite space – a space dominated by people who have cultural advantage. But there is definitely more acceptance now than in 2005-2006 when I graduated from DU.”Though she has not yet spoken to her parents about the Supreme Court judgement, she hopes that things will get easier. “Coming out is a process, you have to keep coming out. But the judgement has been splashed in newspapers across India. So that is going to make the conversation easier, not just with my parents but also with people who live in ignorance about homosexuality. I can surely say that I am a queer now, but even till five years back, I was in denial. I wasn’t homophobic against others but I was still trying to be straight because I thought it makes life easier. It is difficult to be queer, so that is a process that is continuous. I cannot expect my parents to wake up one day and accept this, so you have to hold their hands and keep introducing them to new ideas,” she explains.Abhishek Vats, who is currently in his second year of BA (LLB), was attending his criminal law class when the judgement came out. “As soon as I looked at my phone, I started crying. I think I am so fortunate that I am one of those who got to witness the judgement, because I knew that this is going to change my life,” he says. Abhishek’s parents have always been supportive but he adds, “I think decriminalisation of Section 377 is going to strengthen their support.”Abhishek Vats, LLB (BA) student, Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Management StudiesAbhishek, who is a student of Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Management Studies, says that while growing up, people were quick to form opinions about him.“When I was growing up, I was as flawless as they call it, ‘as queer as you can be’. I walk like a woman, I talk like a woman and I dance like a woman. While growing up, people had such watertight opinions about me. They said that I can’t be a man if I am feminine. They used to say abusive things. It was horrible but I didn’t back down. I realised people were mean to me and thought it was funny to tease me as it used to affect me, but the day I accepted myself, people around me did the same,” says Abhishek.But Abhishek adds that his sexuality is just a facet of his personality. “When I started going to college, I did not speak to people about my sexuality but I continued my life as a gay man. When people started asking me, I openly accepted the fact that I am homosexual. My sexuality is just a facet of who I am,” he says, adding, “Internal acceptance is important, so when I told everybody that I am a gay man, people started talking to me about it. I ensured that they understood that a gay man does not need to wear a sari, a gay man does not need to wear makeup, a gay man can be masculine, he canbe manly.”For Debottam Saha, who is currently pursuing his PhD in Humanities and Social Sciences from IIT-Delhi, the verdict will pave way for the revival of the queer group in a formalised way at the institute which has been dysfunctional for a long time now. “I am overwhelmed, there are lots of things that need to be done. One of the main things is reviving Indradhanush (an informal queer group in IIT), as now we have a proper legal framework to have a dialogue with the administration,” he says.Debottam Saha, Phd student, IIT - DelhiDebottam, who was one of the petitioners from IIT who challenged the constitutionality of Section 377, hails from Kolkata. While his mother and brother are euphoric after the judgement, his father still thinks he needs to get a blood test done because of his sexuality. “The story of my coming out is mostly about my mother and brother. My dad still thinks that I need some blood test to rectify myself, I don’t know what kind of blood test he is hinting at!”Debottam adds, “When I was in school, I used to write in my diary about my male crushes. Once, my mother read the entire diary. She wasn’t comfortable with the idea and I was called by my dad who abused me and I convinced them that I am going to change myself. It was only when I was doing my masters in JNU that I came out to my close friends. I told my mother and gradually, she started to listen to me. I made her read vernacular magazines on gender and that helped her understand me.”Talking about the changes that he hopes the verdict will bring to IIT, he says, “It will definitely help the queer students in IIT. I can’t say that IIT is not a homophobic space but at the same time, there are a couple of faculty members who are supportive. Since the proceedings began in the court, I haven’t encountered any administrative backlash yet, but that can also be because of the fact that the verdict came out as positive. The students seem to have accepted it – I was part of a discussion on gender and sexuality recently in campus and the students were quite vocal about the issue. It is changing, it is going to change, even IIT has taken an initiative and created a gender sensitisation cell in the college, and it is a good sign.

Jindal Global University unveils handbook on rights of transgenders,2018-09-14,NEW DELHI,"News,Education","NEW DELHI: Jindal Global University has unveiled a handbook on the rights of transgenders and gender non-conforming people in India.The handbook, titled ""Rights of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People in India"", was unveiled here by Professor C. Raj Kumar, Founding Vice Chancellor, JGU, on the sidelines of a day-long legal training on the rights of transgenders and gender non-conforming people, as part of the 7th Annual Hijra Habba.The handbook was prepared by Dipika Jain, Associate Professor and Executive Director at the varsity's Jindal Global Law School (JGLS), in collaboration with civil society networks, NGOs and INGOs -- India HIV/AIDS Alliance, Multiple Action Research Group (MARG) and International Commission of Jurists (ICJ).""This handbook simplifies relevant aspects of constitutional and criminal law affecting everyday lives of transgenders and gender non-conforming people,"" Jain said in a statement.The handbook is divided into four chapters: Constitutional Law, Criminal Law, Getting Government Identification, and the Right to Information.It promises to bridge the gap between law and society and serve as an educational and training aid for future legal awareness workshops, according to Danish Sheikh , Assistant Professor at JGLS, who translated the book in Hindi The handbook will be made available online, and in additional seven regional languages, he noted."
Hijra Habba: An event to mark struggle of the third gender,2018-09-14,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Delhi News","NEW DELHI: At traffic signals on busy days, the slight tapping on my car’s window by a transgender would often unnerve me. They are persistent, and there is a common notion that they will cause embarrassment if you don't hand them money. At another friend’s sangeet ceremony, a band of transgenders swayed to peppy tunes amidst peel of laughter. These are the only experiences that I could recall. And so do many others.Hijra Habba was organised in the capital on the 11th of September. The name may sound weird since its synonymous with the transgender community, and so it was. With over 400 transgenders in attendance, Hijra Habba brought diverse voices from across the country, of active members from the LGBT community, to discuss the need for change at the level of education, policy-making and community interaction to effectively normalise lives for the third gender. The event held greater significance in the light of the recent Supreme Court decision decriminalising Section 377 It’s not just Lady Gaga’s popular song, but also the theme of this year’s Hijra Habba. Their lifestyle is not an inconvenience but a truth that we have to accept in all its diverseness. ""Altering the behaviour and attitudes of the people and sensitisation of the masses is the reason why we have this platform"", says Sonal Mehta, Chief Executive, India HIV/AIDS Alliance. Alliance India is an NGO credited with organising this gathering. They work on capacity building, knowledge sharing, technical support and advocacy to people living with HIV . ""A lot of issues pertaining to basic rights and opportunities need to be talked about. They have a right to lead ordinary lives and not be fraught with glass ceilings in the simplest of ideas such as that of a whole family,"" says Nipun Srivastava, consultant for the NGO. While trans people may have been qualified as the third gender, do they, as legitimate citizens, have access to rights and opportunity that others enjoy?Remember Vicks tear jerking ad called Touch of Care? It touched upon the issues of adoption and transgender rights. It featured Gauri Sawant, a beautiful, magnanimous transgender woman and LGBT activist, who adopted a girl named Gayatri, whom she had saved from being sold. She was present at the Hijra Habba, and spoke to timesofindia.com. ""I was the first transgender petitioner to file a case in the Supreme Court regarding adoption rights to transgenders. I am not proud of if but ashamed that I had to go to the court to ask for what should be mine intrinsically.""Gauri has set up her own NGO, Sakhi Char Chowghi in Malad, Mumbai and dedicates her time to providing for other marginalised - transgenders, hijras, female sex workers among other. ""Motherhood is not a state, it is a behaviour. We love someone, which automatically makes us a mother. This need to nurture is natural, and we deserve it as much as a heterosexual woman or man.""Gauri has also started Aaji cha Ghar, a safe and friendly home for the abandoned girl children of sex workers and destitute senior transgenders. It is a project under Sai Sawli Trust and also her dream project. But sadly, Gauri has little support from the government. All help comes from milaap fundraisers. But she is a firm believer in Swami Vivekananda's saying that you must not ask the society what it can do for you, but prove that you can do so much for the society.You and I may celebrate the victory of the community that has been suppressed and made to feel oppressed about their existence, and often completely denied any rights whatsoever. Indians may thump its chest loudly for doing away with the arbitrary and unfair treatment meted out to the LGBTQ community, in theory at least. But the battle is half won, however for the society, because it isn’t just section 377 they fought tooth and nail. With the law finally in their favour, will the marginalised community feel at ease? No.This was the response of over three dozen people who were asked this question. And one of the factors is a common understanding, rooted in some studies, that HIV/AIDS is spread more widely in the LGBTQ community.It is a catcall for discrimination - being HIV positive, or being a transgender. There are some who are both. The National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) India estimates that HIV's prevalence amongst transgenders is at 7.5%. In addition to the deviance inscribed on the bodies of those who are markedly different from the ‘regular’ folk, the stigma attached to people living with HIV has made matters worse.""It is a widely believed that HIV spreads more prominently among homosexuals. We have never been to the root of the issue which is lack of healthcare facilities for the LGBTQ community especially transgenders, who are turned away from hospitals at times due to institutional or individual prejudices. The absence of structural support in terms of education employment and health has made transgenders far more likely to take to substance abuse,"" opines Ritika, who works with Vihaan, a programme that works to reduce stigma and discrimination against HIV affected people. And her words are true. A study by the National Institute of Epidemiology among 60,000 transgender people across 17 states revealed that the biggest perpetrators of violence against transgender people were police and law-enforcing authorities. In a country where the system is against them, this community has little hope.But some people have been fighting this stigma from within the society. Simran Shaikh, a senior program officer at Wajood is one such individual. She enlists why events like Hijra Habba are a necessity. ""Wajood focuses on access to sexual health and mitigating violence among the transgender community. HIV is not transgender community specific; it impacts people all over. But transgenders have been on the receiving end of a lot of sexual abuse, which also exacerbates the current status. Additionally, due to social ostracization, many trans individuals are pushed into becoming sex workers. It also happens due to the unavailability of other job opportunities. Such social realities need to be kept into account when dealing with an HIV positive transgender. They need to be counselled since most of them face familial boycott at a very young age, among other gross injustices such as tantric practices performed on them.""Hijra Habba highlighted the sense of community between people of the LGBTQ spectrum and also brought into light their isolation from the wider society. There were dance and musical performances, a fashion show, and even a theatre performance by Asmita group. It is however a sobering feeling - the community has to put on a show to make its voice heard. Many in the crowd quietly mocked the display of exuberance of the organisers and the participants alike.But it does not deter Simran Shaikh, who adopted a girl, in spite of all deterrence from the society. ""Today they are laughing at us, but they must be absorbing something from this experience. Tomorrow, when they see a transgender begging on the road, they’ll hopefully realise that we are not born to just beg or be sex workers. After today, they will know that we can do a lot more, like any other person around them. We just need a chance. It is our right."""
‘Many religious leaders came up to me for sex’,2018-09-22,VADODARA,,"VADODARA: Rajpipla’s gay prince Manvendra Singh Gohil has made sensational claims stating that many religious leaders of the country had offered to have sex with him.Gohil, who was the country’s first royal to go public about his sexual preference, said this on Thursday while addressing a gathering of students and teachers in a programme organised by Sardar Patel University’s Department of Social Work at education town Vallabh Vidyanagar in Anand district. He was delivering a special talk on ‘LGBTQA: Issues and Concerns’ at the university’s auditorium in the backdrop of the historic judgement of the Supreme Court which earlier this month decriminalised section 377.“In 2013, all the religious leaders of India had united against us. I have said this in United States as well – that India has expertise in creating histories. For the first time in the history of our country, religious leaders of all faiths be it Hindus, Muslims or Christians or X, Y and Z had got united. Why? Because of the same hypocrisy, against section 377,” said Gohil recounting the legal battle that voluntary groups had pursued against section 377 of the IPC dealing with ‘unnatural sexual offences’.“I am not ashamed in saying that many religious leaders have come to me for having sex,” he said, terming it as an example of ‘hypocrisy’.“In fact, while promoting HIV screening, I specifically target ashrams. I ask my volunteers and staffers to go at this ashrams and conduct HIV tests there as there will be HIV positive persons there,” he said.He stressed that decriminalisation of section 377 does not just gives freedom to homosexuals and transgenders but also to all. “This is freedom for entire country. Freedom to lovers, husbands, wives to do sex but with consent. It was because of this that there was celebrations after the verdict of the Supreme Court,” he said.Gohil described the legal battle as a dispute between humanity versus hypocrisy.“I always used to say that we will not succeed if there are more hypocrites in our country. Our country has now shown to the world that there is more humanity in our country than hypocrites,” he said.He said that he recently received a letter from the United States stating that they are patting the back of government of India as it has introduced a law in India which will help support human rights.“They have not used words like homosexuals or transgenders but human rights,” he said."

"At Sion hospital, ‘palatable’ oral pellets for HIV+ kids",2018-07-13,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: The long-standing demand for a more palatable form of HIV medicine for infants has finally been met with the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) rolling out oral pellets in its eight nodal paediatric centres across the country, including Sion hospital in Mumbai.Since little over a month, 16 children aged between six months and two years are being given pellets, which look like homeopathy pills, containing drugs lopinavir and ritonavir. The pellets, that can be sprinkled over food too, have already proven to be advantageous, in terms of administration. The syrup , which used to be the main alternative for paediatric patients, was met with a lot of resistance as it left a bitter aftertaste and children would often spit it out.The centre at Sion hospital will be documenting the efficacy and acceptance of the oral pellets, along with the other centres. “So far, the response has been positive. Earlier, parents would return with the syrup bottles and say it was unpalatable,” said Dr Yashwant Gabhale, head of the paediatric centre at Sion. Additionally, a decrease in side-effects has also been seen. “Problems such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been minimal, so far,” he added.There are nearly 76,000 children living with HIV in the country of which 5,000-odd are from Maharashtra. The use of oral pellets has been restricted to children up to two years of age for now. While the national programme incorporated children since 2006, it was only by late 2007 that paediatric formulations were available. Former paediatric head of Sion hospital Dr Mamata Manglani said that children were initially given adult medication till syrups came into the national programme. “However, there were logistical and storage issues with syrups that paved the way for dispensable tablets over time,” she said.Finding pharmaceutical companies to make child-friendly formulations has always been a challenge, say NACO experts, who hope to scale up once the paediatric centres present their feedback and there are more suppliers. “Currently, Cipla is the only company that is making oral pellet formulation. Mylan is likely to start producing it next,” said NACO’s Dr RS Gupta. He said the introduction of pellets is likely to make a big difference in adherence. “Gulping pills every day is a struggle in itself. It becomes more difficult for babies,” he said. Doctors say the overall adherence among children is more than 90%, till their parents are giving them the medicines.A parent TOI spoke to said oral pellets are undoubtedly easy to administer. “We only hope that it is regularly available and the supply is uninterrupted since there are limited manufacturers,” he said. Not too long ago, the syrup was in short supply across the country."

Meet doctors in old Delhi who treat poor free of cost,2018-07-01,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Delhi News,Civic Issues","NEW DELHI: From running street clinics to giving free-of-cost treatment to poor and homeless, many doctors in old Delhi's Chandni Chowk area are going beyond their line of duty to serve people.A team of three doctors set up a street clinic near the Baptist Church every morning to tend to the poor before going to their work.""I come here for two hours in the morning, tend to those with wounds and then go for my job at a charitable dispensary in Karol Bagh ,"" said Tahir Hussein, one of the doctors who volunteers everyday.The Walled City is home to many needy, including rickshaw-pullers and rag-pickers, who spend their daily lives on streets and pavements and do not have access to proper medical care.National Doctors Day is marked today across the country to recognise the contributions of physicians to individual lives and communities.In India, it commemorates the legacy of legendary doctor and former West Bengal chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy , who was born on this day in 1882.The street clinic, run for the last few years in Chandni Chowk, put spotlight on doctors who have been engaging in philanthropic endeavours to provide healthcare and better quality of life to the poor.The facility in old Delhi is not run by any formal organisation or platform and three doctors and an army officer have come together to run this humble collective.The clinic has surgical equipment, medicine and sterilising agents to deal with varying degrees of injuries, besides treating diseases, said Premjit Singh Panesar, a member of the collective.Panesar, an army officer serving in Mathura, said, his father had started the initiative and, in every two weeks, he comes to old Delhi to check on the clinic.""Since the poor and destitute cannot afford doctors and clinics, we bring the doctors and clinics to them, free of cost. The volunteering doctors attend to all types of cases,"" he told PTI.The Delhi Tuberculosis Association, an NGO, also offers services to people in this part of the capital city by setting up mobile testing units.""We have vans which carry equipment and we station them in the Chandni Chowk area. Our doctors run tests for people living on footpath, for tuberculosis, diabetes and HIV (AIDS). They also give out nutritional food like eggs, along with medicine to aid the treatment. The medicine is provided by the government, we do tests for free,"" said S M Govil, Secretary General of the Association.The doctors serving with the association are volunteers, most of whom have served in the government sector and are now retired. They receive help from the government in the form of HIV testing kits and tuberculosis medication, he said.India has less than one doctor for every 1,000 population which is less than the World Health Organisation standard, according the information shared by the government in Lok Sabha in July last year.The WHO prescribes a doctor population ratio of 1:1000.Leena Sharma, a homeopathic practitioner in Nangloi, said, she treats patients for free on a daily basis.""As doctors, it is our moral and ethical responsibility to make wellness as accessible to people as possible. Doctors make a big impact on lives of those who are sick and cannot afford treatment,"" Sharma said.The Jain Bird Hospital in Chandni Chowk treats injured birds, not only free-of-cost, but also ensures they are released back into their habitat post-treatment.""Many people, who care for birds, bring them with different kinds of injuries to our hospital. We treat them, nurse them and then release them back into their habitats,"" said a veterinarian who works at the hospital.On an average, 50-60 birds are admitted to the hospital daily and it tends to almost an equal number of birds everyday, he said."
‘Used syringes put 90% addicts at risk of Hepatitis C’,2018-07-05,LUDHIANA,,"LUDHIANA: The 90% of injecting drug users (IDU) are always at high risk of getting infected with Hepatitis C and even have chances of becoming HIV positive. The doctors treating the drug addicts at the Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) centre at civil hospital claimed that they have been treating IDUs since 2010, and they conduct blood tests of these patients at regular intervals of 6 months for keeping a tab on their diseases. If Hepatitis C is not treated properly, it can convert to liver cancer which can prove fatal.According to available data of tests being conducted at this centre, out of 416 drug addicts, 358 were found suffering from Hepatitis C in the past six months. In this way, around 86% of the addicts were found suffering from this disease. The addicts get treated in three-month course of medicine at this centre.Similarly, they are prone to get infected HIV, that can later on, lead into AIDS. Though the officials refused to give exact data on HIV+ patients, they shared that 10% of the patients are at the risk of carrying this infection because they use ‘used’ syringes.The in-charge at the OST centre Dr S S Dhir said drug addicts basically suffer from a chronic manageable relapsing disorder and in this centre, they are told to keep regular check on their health. He said they conduct the tests after every six months and do a follow-up so that the patients do not suffer from any major health issue. Dr Dhir further elaborated that drug addicts also suffer from malnutrition, sexually-transmitted diseases and seizures. “We have to deal with them sympathetically so that they get treatment,” he said.Notably, the centre is functional since August 2010 under National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), where addicts and their family members get counselling sessions and at the integrated care centre, tests are conducted on the patients. The basic purpose of this centre is to give addicts medicines orally, so that they should stay away from injections because those are more harmful."

The centre is the first of its kind in the district. The centre is a part of the National Mental Health programme and will be run in association with the mental health unit here. An estimated 150 million individuals are said to have mental health issues in the country.“Under the National Mental Health programme, a district counselling centre will soon be started at PL Sharma District Hospital where patients with mental illness will be able to share their problems with counsellors. Apart from counsellors from mental health unit, counsellors appointed for other units like AIDS and tuberculosis will also be available here,” said Dr PK Bansal, superintendent-in-chief of the district hospital.The counselling centre will function once a week but the day for it is still to be decided. The mental health unit was set at the district hospital last year. Earlier, a mental health unit was available only at Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College.“People do not consider disorders like anxiety as a mental disease, which eventually leads to stress, hypertension and blood pressure. Every individual who has a physical disease also goes through a mental disease side by side and it can be treated only by counselling. The district counselling centre will aim at solving problems of local people by listening to the reasons behind their anxiety and apprehensions,” said Vibha Nagar, clinical psychologist, mental health unit, PL Sharma district hospital."
Pollution-related deaths in Bihar alarming: Study,2018-07-08,PATNA,"News,City News,Patna News,Civic Issues","PATNA: Deaths due to different kinds of pollution account for 33.23% of total deaths in Bihar against the national average of 26.88%, according to a recent study published in the international science journal ‘The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health’.The study has also found that 21.81% of total cases of disabilities in state are due to pollution of different kinds.Findings of the study jointly conducted by Arnhold Institute for Global Health, Mount Sinai Heart and Department of Environmental Medicine and Global Health and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, were deliberated at a consultation workshop organized here on Saturday by Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED). Several organisations, including IIT-Kanpur and Public Health Foundation of India (PFHI), provided India specific data for the study.The study has also found that against the national average of 16.48% of total deaths due to air pollution – ambient as well as indoor – the corresponding figure for Bihar stood at 19.05%. Air pollution also led to 11.63% of total cases of disability in the state.With regard to PM 2.5 levels of ultra-fine particles of less than 2.5 microns which invade human lungs and causes cancer, the report has stated that it led to 11.72% of total deaths in Bihar and 7.32% of total cases of disability.A CEED representative said the Lancet study revealed that deaths due to indoor pollution, primarily due to usage of biomass for cooking food, account for 11.09% of total deaths in Bihar, against the corresponding national average of 7.99%.Similarly, the Lancet study has stated that deaths due to water pollution, including poor sanitation, in Bihar account for 11.97% of total deaths against the national average of 7.65%. Water pollution leads to 7.91% of total disability cases in the state.The only silver lining for Bihar is in the form of deaths due to chemical pollution, primarily lead. The report has stated that deaths due to chemical pollution in India account for 1.68% of total deaths in the country, while the figure in Bihar stands at 1.73%.Dr Gagandeep Kaur Walia, research scientist and assistant professor, PHFI, said the study found that India had the highest percentage of pollution-related deaths globally. “The deaths because of pollution are three times more than HIV, TB and malaria put together. The cities in Bihar should be more cautious as the proportion of deaths because of air pollution is quite high here,” he added.Ankita Jyoti, senior programme officer, CEED, said, “It is all the more imperative for Bihar government to prioritise prevention and control of air pollution. The government needs to expedite the execution on clean air action plan for Patna and make similar plans for Gaya and Muzaffarpur as well.”"

prevalent among Dawoodi Bohra community in India +

NEW DELHI: With the Centre supporting a complete ban on religious practices in certain communities sanctioning female genital mutilation or circumcision, the Supreme Court on Mondayand asked, ""Why should bodily integrity of a woman be subject to a religious practice.""Agreeing with petitioner Sunita Tiwari's arguments through senior advocate Indira Jaising, a bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said, ""Such a religious practice is covered under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act"", which makes touching the genital of a girl less than 18 years an offence.Appearing for Dawoodi Bohra Women's Association for Religious Freedom (DBWRF), lawyer Abhishek Singhvi said the religious practice of ‘khafd' or ‘khatna' prevalent in the community for more than a thousand years involved nipping off a minute part of the genital which was as harmless as male circumcision. This was protected by the Constitution under the fundamental right to religion and religious practices, he said.Singhvi ploughed a lone furrow as attorney general K K Venugopal said male circumcision had certain health benefits including reduction of infection from HIV. However, the AG said female genital mutilation must be banned as it had serious consequences for women. ""It is a crime in the US, the UK, Australia, France and 27 African countries,"" he said. Jaising said a girl child who went genital mutilation suffered from a trauma which lingered into adulthood.Singhvi said the issue, like triple talaq nikah halala and polygamy, should be referred to a five-judge constitution bench to determine the constitutional validity of the religious practice, which was an intrinsic part of Islam.Venugopal differed and said, ""Unlike male circumcision, genital mutilation on a female leads to serious vaginal and uterine complications. Moreover, the fundamental right to religion and religious practice is always subject to public health and morality.""The bench asked, ""Why should anyone have the power based on religious practices to touch the genital of a girl?"" As the bench was insistent on carrying on with arguments, Singhvi cited his preoccupation and sought adjournment. The bench posted the case for detailed hearing on July 16.On April 20, the Centre had told the SC that female genital mutilation,, was already an offence under the Indian Penal Code and POCSO Act.In response to Tiwari's PIL last year, the SC had issued notices to four central ministries — law and justice; health and family welfare; social justice and empowerment and women and child development, and the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Delhi.The petitioner had said the practice of ‘khatna' or ‘female circumcision' or ‘khafd' carried out on minor girls amounted to ""serious violation of the rights of children as even minors have a right of security of person, right to privacy, bodily integrity and the freedom from cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment"".Tiwari had said that though Dawoodi Bohras were among the most educated sections of society in India, yet ""it is the only Muslim community in India to practice FGM or khatna. The practice has nothing to do with religion and is more of a cultural practice"".Tiwari had said the UN Convention on Rights of Child categorised four types of female genital mutilation, though the Bohras generally practised Type-I FGM, which involved snipping the tip of the clitoral hood or clitoris.""A UN resolution passed in December 2012 denouncing FGM and calling for its ban has been signed by 194 countries around the world. In Africa, 27 countries have banned the practice. Unfortunately, there is no law in India yet against FGM, hence the clergy in India is unabashedly promoting FGM,"" Tiwari's PIL had said.

The move was opposed by the chemists’ associations stating such prohibition cannot be imposed as per law and it would result in needle sharing by drug addicts which would lead to transmission of HIV AIDS or hepatitis. Chemists also feared this would result in more online sale of syringes.Now, as per the directions issued on Monday, chemists will have to maintain the record on daily basis as to how many syringes they have sold and how many are left in the stock. At the same time, they will also have to issue proper cash memo to the purchaser taking down his name and address so that the syringe is traceable.It has also been made clear that the concerned deputy commissioner must take over the command to control drugs and not depend upon the police. The deputy commissioners have also been given the liberty to come up with helpline numbers and round the clock control room with the instructions not to set up the control room in police stations but at tehsil office or somewhere else. Guardians of governance would also be lending the helping hand to the district administration in its campaign as they have collected details of the drug addicts in various villages.The DCs were also issued instructions to ensure no death takes place due to drugs. In case any person is unable to bear the expenses of drug de-addiction treatment, the state would would bear the medical expenses in government hospitals.The district administration heads have also been directed to send across a strong message that concerned SHOs would be held responsible in case of drug menace flourishing under their area."
HIV: Most people with STDs in country are from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh,2018-06-23,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Amaravati News","HYDERABAD: Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have reported the highest number of people with sexually-transmitted diseases in the country, according to National Health Profile of India 2018.The report says, in 2016 around 8,056 cases of syphilis, that amount to 35 per cent of total cases, was reported in Telangana alone. In 2017, Andhra Pradesh reported the highest number of syphilis cases: around 5,155. For gonorrhoea, Telangana reported the highest number of cases (19,884) followed by AP in 2016; in 2017 AP recorded highest in the country.Centre has released the report on the health profile of various states on June 19. Health experts disagree with the Centre.Robotic urologist and microsurgical andrologist Dr Kammela Sridhar said, “Promiscuity is high in the two states. Genital hygiene and nonuse of condom and improper use of condom are general factors. Homosexuality has increased. The risk of transmitting STDs and HIV is 16 times more in homosexuals.”According to National Health Profile of India 2018, Telangana and AP have reported the highest number of people with sexually-transmitted diseases in India.Robotic urologist and microsurgical andrologist Dr Kammela Sridhar said, “In Telangana and AP obesity is highest in the country. Due to fat in the body, the immune system is less effective. Due to heavy sweating, particularly in AP coast, genital hygiene is affected. Tamil Nadu has worked well to bring down STDs and HIV.”However, dermatologists say figures by Union health ministry should be relooked into and could be defective.Dermatologist Dr George Valsan of Sarada Hospital in Sainikpuri says, “We have been receiving a number of cases of syphilis and gonococcal infections. In 8,000-10,000 patients, I get two or three cases of gonorrhoea a year. Syphilis has also drastically increased. Around 4-5 cases are reported a month. Maybe, more cases are reported in government hospitals. But the figures put out by the Centre should be revisited. HIV infections are there. Almost 65% are fungal infections like candidiasis, and viral infections like herpes simplex have increased.”In January 2018, an Osmania and Gandhi Medical College and ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute, Pune, study found that multi-drug resistant strains of gonorrhoea were seen. At least 20 cases in Secunderabad and 16 in Hyderabad, verified by researchers, were found. A total of 98% isolates of gonorrhoea were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 52% to penicillin, 56% tetracycline and 5% azithromycin.AP also recorded highest number of acute respiratory infection deaths and cases after UP. In 2017, due to acute respiratory infections, 324 people died in AP and 26 in Telangana."
Chennai welcomes Miss India World 2018,2018-06-28,"The airport was buzzing and those waiting were all excited. And then, fbb Colors Femina Miss India World 2018 Anukreethy Vas landed to a frenzy of flowers, presents, garlands, banners and placards that read ‘Welcome Miss India 2018’. Her day was packed, and she had so much to do in that one day. We take you through her day, with her...Chennai airport is a busy place, but it definitely never was this buzzing, with so many people waiting for just one person at the arrival point. But then, it’s not every day that fbb Colors Femina Miss India World 2018 , Anukreethy Vas, who also won the title of fbb Miss Beauty with a Purpose (BWAP), comes to Chennai. One of the first things that Anukreethy did was to ask after her BWAP project Agni, which is about right to education for all; she also enquired about her other projects, which are to run an NGO that helps educate underprivileged children. She is helping run an orphanage with 30 kids and helping 30 transgender to study and to stay and live on their own, in Tamil Nadu.“Let’s rehearse for one more time — Welcome Miss India… woo-hoo…” announced Namitha Marimuthu who represented the state in Miss Trans Queen India 2017. She’d gathered many of her friends from the LGBT community and they all had come to the airport to welcome Anukreethy Vas. They kept flowers and a welcome banner ready, and were also dressed in beautiful fancy clothes to look their best on this special day.Anu’s mother Seleena was excited and nervous at the same time. She got emotional, and said, “I have no words. I am so proud of my daughter today. She is a confident girl and she always used to tell me, ‘Amma, don’t worry, I will win the title.’ She believes in staying positive in any situation. Today, I haven’t brought any big present to welcome my daughter; my love is the only gift that I could bring to the airport. I just got these flowers because she is fond of flowers.”Cousin Prabhu Sundar who flew in from Kuwait in the morning to welcome Anukreethy, told us, “She is not only my cousin, she is my best friend. We are very proud of her. We are also confident that she will bring the Miss World crown to India and we will come back here again to receive her. I don’t have any big present for her, but I managed to get some chocolates for my sister. After two days, I am throwing a big party; it will be at home, with family and close friends.”Saffiberry, her close friend, who told us he is more like an elder brother to her, was busy coordinating with the Miss India team and arranging everything so that Anukreethy’s day in Chennai goes smoothly. “I can’t express in words how happy and overwhelmed we are. To be honest, we didn’t expect her to bring the crown home. This doesn’t mean that she is not talented enough; we just never expected such a big thing to happen in our lives. This is a moment of immense pride for all of us, in fact, for the entire country.Members of Ooruni Foundation, Non Profit and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) were also gathered at the airport to welcome Miss India with flower bouquets and a cake. They said they have a special bond with Anukreethy as she has been a part of the NGO in supporting orphans and HIV-positive kids, and has also been generating awareness on child education by working with them on various projects.Finally, Anukreethy came out of the airport holding high the Indian flag. Mother Seleena couldn’t wait longer and she hugged her daughter tight and kissed her on her cheeks. All the friends, brothers, members of NGO and LGBT community gathered close to her and welcomed her with bouquets. A session of selfies that was up on social media instantly followed this. A few of them even kept their phone active to go live on social media the moment she walked in. There was a quick cake-cutting celebration; everyone took their turn to feed Anukreethy a slice of the cake. Cousin Prabhu finally handed over the cute box of chocolates to his sister. This was followed by welcoming her with garlands, presents and bouquets from well-wishers.Anukreethy changed into a yellow floral gown for her session at the LGBT home in T Nagar. She was welcomed with a special aarti. Namitha was super exited to take a picture with her wearing the crown and sash that she won for representing TN in Miss Trans Queen India 2017. There was a cake-cutting moment, and again a flurry of selfies followed.Children at the Child, Children Home in Kolathur were decking up their home with balloons and drawings on the board to welcome Anukreethy when she walked in. They all hugged her the moment she walked in and screamed, “Congratulations akka, oh, our Miss India,” and everybody laughed. They sang a special prayer for her and told her that she will bring home the Miss World, title too. After some more cake-cutting, Anukreethy sat with the children to feast on the scrumptious home-cooked Tamil seven-course meal — the ela sappadu for you and me... she had no airs in promptly squatting down and eating with her hands. “I have been dying to eat a traditional south Indian meal,” she laughed.The eventful day ended with a quiet dinner time with family and close friends at a five star hotel. And this time, fbb Colors Femina Miss India World 2018, Anukreethy Vas, was dressed in a green off-shoulder dress. Post dinner, she went to Puducherry for a day. Today, she will be in Trichy, where a grand welcome awaits her, and she will be back in Chennai tomorrow to continue with the celebrations.","News,City News,Chennai News","The airport was buzzing and those waiting were all excited.

Zero risk blood-transfusion not possible: Centre to court,2018-06-28,KOCHI,"News,City News,Kochi News","KOCHI: It is not possible to detect presence of HIV in blood donated by donors infected with the disease within three weeks to two months, central government has informed the Kerala High Court.The submission by central government counsel Premlatha K Nair was in the form of a statement filed on behalf of the secretary of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.Central government’s statement, relying on instruction from National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) assistant director MK Diwaker, said there is a “minimal risk” of infections such as HIV, HBV (Hepatitis B), and HCV (Hepatitis C) despite testing all blood units prior to transfusion due to a window period ranging from few days to few weeks during which such infections cannot be detected by laboratory testing.Use of newer technology for testing, including Nucleic Acid Test NAT ), is recommended by the ministry but it is not mandatory. Scientifically, there cannot be a zero risk blood-transfusion, the statement filed in court said. The best option is to recruit and retain a pool of healthy, voluntary blood donors, the statement noted.Central government was responding to the petition filed by Shiji, father of the nine-year-old girl who was tested positive for HIV after undergoing blood transfusion at Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) at Thiruvananthapuram.Report of the enquiry conducted by Kerala State AIDS Control Society as directed by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) of the ministry was also submitted to the court. Blood collection formalities and screening of blood or products were done at RCC as per guidelines issued by NACO and NBTC and the only possibility of HIV infection during blood transfusion is the window period. Another possibility is that the girl may already have been in the window period when she was admitted to RCC, the report said."

"birth control: 'Now, few takers for ‘government condoms’ as users look for other options'",2018-06-30,"Are condoms slowly making way for other popular methods of contraception like pills and injections? So it seems as far as the number of people using condoms distributed by the central government free of cost through various schemes, hospitals and ASHA workers is concerned..The Union ministry of health and family welfare, in reply to an RTI dated June 13, 2018, has informed that the number of condom-users has gone down in 19 states over the last six years. Interestingly, all the Union Territories have increased figures in terms of condom-users with Dadra and Nagar Haveli posting the highest rise — 2,680 in 2016-17 from 1,116 in 2011-12.Talking to TOI, Noida-based sexuality rights activist Pallavi Barnwal said, “Condom usage is associated with various myths such as lessened gratification, pleasure and interference with sexual performance. Men also think that it’s easier for a woman to pop in an I-pill. Besides, a surge in marketing and sales of emergency contraceptive pills has also led to a decline in condom usage.”The states where the number of government-distributed condom users have gone down are Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Tripura and Uttarakhand.In 2011-12, Rajasthan registered 10,84,700 users which dipped to 6,50,542 in 2016-17, making the state lose the highest number of users. Uttar Pradesh, which had 6,87,905 users in 2011-12, the figure has declined to 6,05,052 in 2016-17.When contacted, an official in the ministry said, “There are often misquotations from the data collectors. We are working to reduce the gap and will soon be able to upload the same on public domain.” He, however, added that it may also be true that people are increasingly opting for other methods of contraception like pills, injections, vasectomy and tubectomy for which the use of condoms has come down.Bangalore-based hotelier Sourish Ghosh feels the figures do not portray the real scenario. “How many do you think opt for government-distributed condoms? These days, the social taboo related to buying condoms is lessening and it is easy for people to avail them from pharmacies. I think a private data will show otherwise,” said Ghosh.Additional director of Jharkhand State Aids Control Society (JSACS) Dr B N Poddar feels this is good news for his state. “The scenario in Jharkhand is a bit different. Our awareness programmes are related to preventing AIDS and I believe the number of people engaging in risky sex has gone down. I believe many have also switched to other forms of contraception.”Chief medical officer of health East Mednipore (West Bengal) Dr N C Mandal said, “A lot of people these days are switching over to other forms of contraceptives like pills, Copper-Ts and injections. Earlier, there were limited options and thus condoms gained popularity.”The RTI reply shows the number of condoms distributed free of cost by the government in 2011-12 was 59,61,251 which came down to 45,76,642 in 2016-17. The data provided through the RTI also shows that the number of condom users in the country was 1,50,15,973 (figure includes free distribution and distribution under social marketing programme) in 2011-2012. This came down to 1,01,33,029 in 2016-17.A pertinent question here is can reduced use of condoms lead to a rise in sexually-transmitted diseases (STD) and also AIDS. Popping a pill can easily help one get rid of unwanted pregnancy but not the killer HIV, which condoms can effectively keep at bay.

The data provided through the RTI also shows that the number of condom users in the country was 1,50,15,973 (figure includes free distribution and distribution under social marketing programme) in 2011-2012. This came down to 1,01,33,029 in 2016-17.A pertinent question here is can reduced use of condoms lead to a rise in sexually-transmitted diseases (STD) and also AIDS. Popping a pill can easily help one get rid of unwanted pregnancy but not the killer HIV, which condoms can effectively keep at bay. If a survey shows in future that more and more people are contracting AIDS for reduced condom usage, there is no denying the fact that we are heading towards a serious health challenge."
China approves first home made anti-HIV drug,2018-06-06,BEIJING,"News,World News,China News","BEIJING: China has approved the first domestically developed, long-acting injectable HIV drug Albuvirtide which could be a boon to tens of thousands of HIV/AIDS patients in the country, the official media reported.The drug, approved by the China Food and Drug Administration, can block the fusion of the virus and host cell membranes, interrupting the HIV life cycle in its earliest stage, state-run Global Times quoted a report from Science and Technology Daily.Albuvirtide is injected once a week and is secure, a staff from the Nanjing-based Frontier Biotechnologies Inc, surnamed Zhu, told Global Times.Compared to imported anti-HIV drugs, Albuvirtide has fewer side effects, especially on the liver, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, quoting Wu Hao , head of the infection centre at Beijing You'an Hospital.The drug is a fusion inhibitor that should be used with antiretroviral drugs to treat people with HIV condition who have received antiviral therapy, the company said.Albuvirtide could potentially enhance patient compliance, improve quality of life and reduce treatment costs for HIV-infected patients, it wrote.Current HIV treatments used in China are either generic or imported. AIDS and HIV patients mostly took a handful of pills every day, Peng Xiaohui , a sexologist at Central China Normal University, told the Global Times.""China's first domestically developed drug offers new HIV patients a new treatment option. We hope to dispel the fact that China has not developed good anti-AIDS medicine,"" Xie Dong , chief scientist and former head of Frontier Biotechnologies Inc was quoted by the Science and Technology Daily as saying.Several companies are developing long-acting AIDS drugs in China, but only Frontier's drug has been approved, the Xinhua report said.Peng said the patients have to overcome psychological obstacles first since they need to inject medicine on their own or have a doctor do it for them.According to official data China has 718,270 people suffering from HIV/AIDS in China.As of the end of June last year, 221,628 people had died of AIDS-related diseases in China, according to a Xinhua report of December 2017."
AIDS control trust to reach out to HIV+ blood donors,2018-06-08,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: Considering that some donors at blood banks test positive for HIV but don’t return for counselling and treatment, Mumbai District AIDS Control (MDACS) has introduced a system to reach out to them.Every donated unit of blood is tested for diseases such as HIV and hepatitis viruses. The ones with infections are called, counselled and put through another round of HIV-testing. But in Mumbai there is a gap between numbers who test positive and those who return for counselling and treatment, said MDACS officials.In 2016-17, 0.29% of the blood from banks was positive for HIV. Given the new WHO call to put every HIV-positive person on treatment at the earliest to ensure a better quality of life, MDACS increased efforts to find HIV-positive persons and start them on treatment.It issued a circular on June 5 advising blood banks on how to take the history of blood donors and how to counsel them. Blood banks have to retest any blood unit that tests positive for HIV and call the donor for a retest and counselling session at the nearest government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC). “But in practice, such donors never return to the centres. There is a significant gap between positive sample detected and donors who return for a confirmation,"" said asenior doctor.MDACS additional project director Dr Shrikala Acharya has written that in collaboration with American Center’s for Diseases Control, India has initiated an exercise to assess reasons for this discordance. “It has also been decided that such donors should be referred to any ICTC they are comfortable to visit,"" said Dr Acharya."

HIV vaccine comes closer to reality,2018-06-11,WASHINGTON DC,News,"WASHINGTON DC: HIV vaccine could soon be a reality.Researchers have found that Treg cells, a type of regulatory lymphocyte, might be protecting babies in the womb from getting infected with the HIV virus when the mother is infected.""Finding out what protects the majority of babies is important, as it can lead to ways to boost natural immune responses and make individuals resistant to HIV infection,"" said researcher Peter Kessler from the Emory University School of Medicine.Scientists had been puzzled for years by the fact that only a minority of babies born to mothers with HIV infection get the infection from their mothers.Currently, HIV infection can be successfully managed with antiretroviral drugs, but these drugs have to be given for life. Preventing the infection is very important, but there is no vaccine available yet.Researchers found that levels of Treg lymphocytes were higher in the blood of newborn babies born to mothers with HIV infection who had escaped the infection themselves, compared with babies who were born with HIV infection.Lymphocytes are cells of the immune system that protect the body by fighting bacteria and viruses. Treg cells, or regulatory T cells, are an important ""self-check"" in the immune system to prevent excessive immune reactions that could lead to tissue damage.The researchers examined the blood of 64 babies who were born HIV-uninfected and 28 babies born HIV-infected and found that Treg cell levels were higher in uninfected babies at the time of birth. In contrast, other lymphocyte types were activated and higher in HIV-infected infants. The HIV virus can only infect cells that are activated, so Treg may protect from HIV infection by suppressing activation of other lymphocytes.They analyzed the stored blood by flow cytometry, a technique that can differentiate between the different types of cells based on what markers they express on their surface. Regulatory T cells come in many forms with the most well-understood being those that express the markers CD4, CD25, and FOXP3.""Even though the number of babies studied is relatively small, these findings indicate that Treg, by controlling immune activation, may lower the vulnerability of the babies to HIV or other chronic infections even before they are born,"" said Kessler.These results could pave the way for the development of vaccines or other immune-based therapies that could be used together with medications to prevent the spread of HIV or other infections from mothers to their babies."
Being positive in the face of adversities,2018-05-18,AHMEDABAD,"News,City News,Ahmedabad News,Civic Issues","AHMEDABAD: Nimisha, a school teacher from Bharuch , hot herself tested when she kept falling ill. When she was told that she was HIV+, her world changed. When she told her in-laws about it, she got another shock. Her husband was an AIDS patient and the fact had been hidden from her.Jagruti, a resident of Anand, could not believe her ears when she was told by the hospital that she was HIV+. The revelation came when her husband underwent a similar test and found to be positive. Her in-laws later told her that they knew it for long. The couple’s child, 18 months of age at that time, was also found to be positive. The husband died but Jagruti had to fight with not only her in-laws but also school authorities when one of the teachers identified her son as ‘AIDS patient’ in a classroom.When HIV+ and AIDS still evoke horror in the society, these are just a few cases out of over 100 compiled in ‘Stars of the Ground,’ a book published by Gujarat State Network of People living with HIV+ (GSNP+) in collaboration with Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), chronicling struggles of women living with HIV+.Daksha, founder of a Surat-based GSNP+, is HIV+ along with her husband. “Our purpose is to put forth the plight of the women who face double discrimination due to their positive status and more often than not being at the end of accusations of being the cause of the disease for their husbands and even questioning their character. They find it difficult to get jobs or even social acceptance once their status is known. But we have to address the elephant in the room and create awareness. We chose to tell stories of these women who braved all odds and are today living with their heads high,” she said.The book covers a wide range of women, right from a former sarpanch of a village to teachers, social workers, a diamond polisher and a former sex worker. What connected the narratives is the collective horror they went through. According to the book, Junagadh collector had to intervene in a case where a village ostracised a woman with HIV+ after death of her husband and threatened her of dire consequences if she drew water or worked in farms. In another case, a woman from Surat district tried to kill her on pretext of giving her medicines.Gaurang Jani, a city-based sociologist who was advisor on the project, said that the need of the hour is creating awareness about HIV+ so that preventive tests can be encouraged. “Gujarat has about 1.66 lakh persons with HIV+. They choose not to reveal their status, fearing isolation. In a majority of the cases covered in the book, the women are either living on their own or with their parents as they are invariably thrown out from their matrimonial homes,” he said.But all’s not bleak. Hiral, a resident of Surat, lost her HIV+ husband after which she first started a beauty parlour and is now the matron at a girls’ hostel, caring for 52 girls. Manisha, a resident of Vadodara, decided to start afresh after her husband died and married an HIV+ man. The couple are working for HIV+ couples and individuals.(Names changed to protect identities)"
rte: RTE admission process put on hold to effect changes,2018-05-19,PUNE,"News,City News,Pune News,Schools & Colleges","PUNE: The admission process to fill the 25% reservation quota under the Right to Education Act has been stopped for seven days to effect changes in the criteria for application.Students who were previously unable to enrol themselves for admissions will be able to take part once the online system resumes. The income limit of Rs one lakh will no longer be the criteria for children from socially backward classes. It will be valid only for open category students.According to the state education department (primary), apart from scheduled caste and scheduled tribes, children belonging to socially backward categories including denotified tribes, nomadic tribes, special backward class and other backward class irrespective of the income of their parents will be considered under the 25% quota admissions.Students suffering from HIV will also be considered for admission irrespective of the income of their parents. Director of education, Sharad Gosavi, said, “Several students across the state will now be able to benefit because of these minor, but important, changes in the criteria for admissions. The changes will be effective immediately.”The education department has stopped the admission online portal to incorporate the changes in the online system and create awareness among beneficiaries. Once the changes are made, the admission process will resume and those who missed the chance during the first round can also apply, Gosavi added.Parents who have already made applications can also make changes in their forms. In these seven days, parents of the beneficiary students can start applying on the website. After May 21, the admission round will be conducted, said Gosavi. He said, “Because of this decision, there will be a major rise in the number of applications across the state.”Mukund Kirdat of the Aam Aadmi Party parents’ association said, “There has been a tremendous delay in the RTE admission process this year and with new changes introduced, there is possibility of further delay. The education department must announce a detailed schedule and ensure that no student suffers amidst all the changes in the process. All eligible students must benefit from the decision.”"
62% jump in HIV/AIDS deaths in city in one year: Health ministry,2018-05-19,Mumbai,"News,City News,Mumbai News","Mumbai: Deaths due to AIDS (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) have increased significantly in the city over the last three years, according to data available with the central health ministry’s Health Management Information System . While 27 HIV-positive people died in Mumbai in 2015-16, the number rose to 72 in 2016-17 and further to 116 in 2017-18, showed the data.“There has been a 62% increase in deaths due to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the last one year alone,” said RTI activist Chetan Kothari , who compiled the data. Between 2015 and 2016, the deaths rose by 166%.The HIV/AIDS epidemic, that had peaked in the nineties, has become manageable due to availability of medicines called antiretroviral treatment (ART); a fatal disease was soon transformed into a chronic condition manageable with drugs. Number of deaths fell as a result even as the number of fresh HIV infections began to show a decline in the last few years.In this backdrop, the sudden spurt in deaths is worrisome, said doctors. A senior doctor, who didn’t want to be identified, said, “Deaths occur in poor patients in whom the current mode of treatment has failed.” Patients for whom the first line of ART no longer worked due to years of use, needed second- or third-line drugs. “However, these new medicines are expensive and not easily available in the government-run programme. The poor cannot afford to buy them,” the doctor added.However, city authorities in charge of the HIV/AIDS control programme said there is a simple explanation for the increase: A sharper public health programme that has managed to track more patients Dr Shrikala Acharya of the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) said the organization had carried out intensive loss-to-follow-up drives as per central government directives to track patients who were lost to follow-up. “This drive helped us update the actual number of deaths. It could also be the reason for the increase in reported deaths,” she said, adding that the rise isn’t necessarily an actual increase in the number of deaths.Incidentally, the HMIS data shows that the number of AIDS deaths has been steadily decreasing across Maharashtra. From 1,426 deaths in 2015-16, the figure fell to 1,390 in the following year and further to 1,327 in 2017-18. A doctor said that HIV care has improved so much that very few deaths are recorded in the private sector, where patients pay for the latest medicine and get updated care."
62% jump in HIV/AIDS deaths in Mumbai in 1 year: Health ministry,2018-05-19,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News,Civic Issues News","MUMBAI: Deaths due to AIDS (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) have increased significantly in the city over the last three years, according to data available with the central health ministry’s Health Management Information System . While 27 HIV-positive people died in Mumbai in 2015-16, the number rose to 72 in 2016-17 and further to 116 in 2017-18, showed the data.“There has been a 62% increase in deaths due to the HIV/ AIDS epidemic in the last one year alone,” said RTI activist Chetan Kothari, who compiled the data. Between 2015 and 2016, the deaths rose by 166%.The HIV/AIDS epidemic, that had peaked in the nineties, has become manageable due to availability of medicines called antiretroviral treatment (ART); a fatal disease was soon transformed into achronic condition manageable with drugs. Number of deaths fell as a result even as the number of fresh HIV infections began to show a decline in the last few years.In this backdrop, the sudden spurt in deaths is worrisome, said doctors. A senior doctor, who didn’t want to be identified, said, “Deaths occur in poor patients in whom the current mode of treatment has failed.” Patients for whom the first line of ART no longer worked due to years of use, needed second- or third-line drugs.“However, these new medicines are expensive and not easily available in the governmentrun programme.

Kerala: Four accused of killing Kerala transgender activist acquitted,2018-05-19,KOLLAM,"News,City News,Kochi News,Crime","KOLLAM: Six years after the brutal killing of one of Kerala’s first transgender activists — 39-year-old Anil Sadanandan also know as ‘Maria’ — a local district and sessions court in Kollam earlier this month acquitted all four youths of murder charges. Additional district and sessions judge Asheeda F held that the four accused, Hyder Farooq of Mayyanad, Priyan M of Kadappakada, Vishnu C of Pattathanam and Nahas N, were not guilty of the offences that they were prosecuted for, including murder and unnatural sex.The court said that the evidence produced against the accused by the prosecution was not satisfactory.The judge, however, convicted the main accused Farooq for theft, for allegedly stealing the deceased Sadanandan’s laptop from his house. “(Farooq) pleaded mercy of the court. Even though no previous offence is proved against him, he is sent to rigorous imprisonment for two years for the offence,” the judge said, adding that the sentence can be he is eligible for set off against the jail time he has already served.Sadanand was a prominent activist between 2010 and 2012 — leading pride marches in Kerala in a rainbow gown. The prosecution had alleged ‘HIV panic’ as the motive for the crime.According to the police, Farooq suspected that he had contracted HIV from Sadanandan with whom he had sexual relations. Medical tests subsequently had ruled out that either of them was HIV positive.A 39-year-old government employee working in the Harbour department as a toll collector in Thangaserry, Kollam, Sadanandan was married and had a son.On the morning of May 10, 2012, a colleague who came to Anil Sadanandan’s quarters to inquire about why he had not shown up at work, discovered his body lying naked in a pool of blood.Farooq, Priyan and Vishnu, all in their early 20s, were charged with the murder. A fourth accused Nahas N(21), was charged with helping the trio get a new mobile connection.According to the police, th three accused Farooq, Priyan and Vishnu hatched a criminal conspiracy. They had a party at Sadanandan’s staff quarters and had sexual intercourse before slitting his throat. The postmortem report of the victim had revealed 22 stab wounds.Advocate G Gopakumar, counsel for the accused, said that they were falsely implicated in the case. The prosecution’s case hinged on the statement of two witnesses, who the police said had last seen the accused enter the quarters. In court, the two witnesses turned hostile and it this proved fatal to the prosecution case.“The evidence was planted. The Police had not submitted the mobile phone tower records to pinpoint the location of the accused at the time of the murder. Another evidence, including an alleged extrajudicial confession was suspicious,” said advocate Gopakumar .Special public prosecutor A K Manoj, told TOI, that the state would appeal the acquittal in the high court.“There is convincing evidence against Farooq, Priyan and Vishnu and the state will file an appeal,” said prosecutor Manoj."
The onus of taking birth control measures almost always on women,2018-05-20,VISAKHAPATNAM,"News,City News,Visakhapatnam News","VISAKHAPATNAM: The country may have advanced in various spheres, but when it comes to family planning or opting for birth control , in more than 80% of the cases, the onus is on the women to use contraceptives, observed doctors from both government and private hospitals in the city.In the Government Victoria Hospital for Women and Children, while around 300 women undergo family planning procedures in a month, there are only around three men who undergo vasectomy in a year.Dr Mehar Kumar, in-charge superintendent from Victoria Hospital said, “We do about 10 surgical cases of family planning per day (for couples who already have two children), which means around 300 per month. Around 50% are double puncture laparoscopic sterilisation, while the remaining are post-partum sterilisation. We get around 50 cases of normal deliveries per month and placement of post-partum intra uterine device (PPIUD) in cases where the couple has given birth to their first child and want some time before the birth of the next child. But rarely do we get men opting for family planning, not more than two-three cases a year.”Dr S Anuradha , consultant gynaecologist and specialist in high risk pregnancies said, “The mindset of society has not advanced and therefore even though vasectomy is a easy and risk-free process, it is not opted by men. Various myths and misconceptions deter men from undergoing vasectomy as they mistakenly think that they will become sexually weaker or cannot undertake heavy tasks. In fact, rather than focusing on post-partum sterilisation immediately after the birth of the second child, the government should conduct awareness campaigns to popularise vasectomy, which comprises no stitches but a small cut and post-operative complications and infections associated with tubectomy can be avoided.”However, the mode of contraception also differs region-wise. For instance, women from Odisha mostly use oral contraceptives while those from AP generally opt for tubectomy, observed the doctor. “Nowadays, some urban women are also using injectable contraceptives every three months instead of daily oral ones. Condom usage, which in addition to preventing unwanted pregnancies also checks transmission of HIV and STDs, is also limited among few educated men,” added Dr Anuradha.Sometimes, married women land up in unwanted pregnancy and abortions as in-laws ask them not to use contraception at all under superstitious beliefs that it would affect pregnancy later on. Dr MNV Pallavi, chief consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Omni R K Hospital , said, “Not only the onus of using birth control techniques is on women, we get four-five cases of unwanted pregnancy per month as the newly-wed couples have not used any form of contraception, especially from rural areas. While the husbands say they are not comfortable using condoms, the wife has been discouraged by the elders from using pills under the myth that it would affect her chances of future pregnancy. They lack the awareness that using contraceptives is much better than undergoing medical termination of pregnancy (MTP), fraught with various risks. Those planning children at a later date can take oral pills or use IUDs for spacing between children, which are quite safe. However, emergency contraceptive pills should be avoided at all cost unless it is really an emergency situation when an unprotected intercourse has taken place but the pregnancy needs to be avoided.”"
4 girls fight all odds to pursue higher studies: Four village girls fight all odds to pursue higher studies,2018-05-21,LUDHIANA,"News,City News,Ludhiana News","LUDHIANA: Making best efforts to promote girls education, two UK and Canada-based NGOs being run by NRIs have adopted four girls of Barundi village, 31km away from Ludhiana city, for their education. All four girls belong to a poor family background. However, fighting all odds, they have been scoring excellent marks.Seva Trust of UK and Global Girls Power of Canada are NGOs being run by Charan Kanwal Sekhon and Lucky Gill respectively, who have roots in Ludhiana. On Friday, the NGOs adopted four girls – Manpreet Kaur , Sapna Rani, Prabhjot Kaur, and another girl (the daughter of HIV parents) — who are meritorious students. However, due to their financial conditions, they are facing hurdles to pursue further education.Sekhon, who belongs to Barundi village, said: “The Seva Trust and Global Girls Power have raised a fund of Rs 1 lakh, which has been distributed among five students — including these four girls — for their education. Our organizations will further keep sending them money till the time they want to study.”Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM-Raikot) Kanu Thind distributed cheques of Rs 20,000 each to the four girls on Friday. A cheque of Rs 20,000 was also given to Kamaljeet Singh — a student of class VI of Sahli village — who writes with his foot.Manpreet Kaur (21) is certainly not living an easy life. Her day starts by working in houses as a domestic help, followed by her college, and ends again working in the houses of her village. Manpreet’s mother Paramjeet Kaur is separated from her husband for long. Paramjeet has been working as a domestic help in the village to earn for her family, and later, both her daughters also joined her.For the past two years, Manpreet has been working as a domestic help and studying simultaneously. Fighting all odds, she managed to score 70% marks in class 12. However, after that, she could not arrange money for her admission in college. Then, with the help of a college professor, she got admission in a college where she is getting a fee concession.She says: “I, my mother, and younger sister earn a total of Rs 4,000 a month. In this income, we can hardly earn a meal for three times. With the help of a professor, I managed to get admission in BA-I. However, I have been paying transport fee and examination fee. But with our total income, I am not even able to pay for transport.”She wakes up at 5am, and starts working in houses from 6am to 7am. By 8am, her college bus comes to pick her up. She returns from college by 3.30pm, and again works as a help in houses till 6.30pm. She said: “ At times, we don’t have enough food to eat, and in this condition, how could I get an education. I am so thankful to Seva Trust and Global Girls Power for sponsoring my education. I want to become a teacher and support my family. I don’t want my younger sister to work in houses to arrange money for my education.”Sapna Rani (17), who had cleared class 12 in 2016-17 with 69% marks, had to drop further studies as her family could not arrange money. Sapna’s parents work as labourers in the village. To support her family, her elder brother also started working after class 5.She said: “We our four siblings. My two brothers work with my father as labourers, and my younger sister studies in school. I wanted to study further after school, however we had nobody. I felt really bad when I went to school to get my detailed marks card, and everyone was asking if I had got admission in a college. For the past one year, I am at home helping my mother in household chores.”However now, with the help of NGOs, Sapna is getting admission in BCA in a private college. She said: “After graduation, I will pursue a Masters Degree, and want to become a banker.”Prabhjot Kaur (16) studies in a school affiliated to CBSE. However, two years ago, when her father fell into depression, hard times started for her family. Prabhjot’s father Sukhwinder Singh lost his land and transportation business last year, following which he fell into depression. He also attempted suicide. The family also lost their elder son, a taxi driver, who was killed by robbers in Delhi.“I study in class X and my monthly fee is Rs 1,530, while my brother’s monthly fee — who studies in class IV — is Rs 1,160. After my father went into depression, it was hard for us to pay even our monthly fees. Then, my mother started stitching clothes to earn a living. Besides, my paternal uncles helped us by sending rations and some cash.”Prabhjot said her family was planning to shift both children to a government school. She says she wants to pursue commerce stream next year, and earn money for her family.She scored 72% marks in class XII. However, recently when her father met with an accident, he was diagnosed with HIV. After that, her mother also got her tests done, and she too was found HIV positive.The girl’s father was a truck driver. But since the time he was diagnozed with HIV, he left the house, and he has not returned home for the past nine months. Meanwhile, his wife has been working as a labourer in village farms. She said: “My mother is getting her treatment in hospital, but by working as a labourer in farms, she is not able to earn enough for my education.”She got admission in BBA last year, and is now getting sponsorship for her college fee."
Dist hospital’s Mann Kaksh to tackle mental illness to start from next week,2018-05-21,Bareilly,"News,City News,Bareilly News","Bareilly: Mann Kaksh (counselling centre) for dealing with cases of mental illness will become functional at the district hospital from next week.Officials said the construction work is completed and once the staff is transferred here, it will start functioning by next week. The centre will have a psychiatrist, psychologists and counsellors for diagnosing mental illness and providing counselling to those affected by HIV, addicted to alcohol and drugs or are facing family disputes.Mann Kaksh will have two helpline numbers — a landline and mobile number — for registering complaints of people seeking counselling.Dr KS Gupta, chief medical superintendent, said, “Six chambers for counselling have been constructed. The centre is ready. We will distribute pamphlets for publicity of the counselling centre.’’On the lines of Mann Kaksh at hospitals in Madhya Pradesh, the UP government has decided to construct similar centres at all district hospitals of the state. Sources said 45 districts have been selected for setting up such centres in the first phase and Rs 3 lakh each has been allotted for the purpose. However, Mann Kaksh has become functional in a few districts of the state. The centre has a tagline taken from Ramayan — “Kahe te kuch dukh ghati hui, kahi kaho yeh jaan na koi.” (Our sorrow decreases when it is shared with someone but people do not know whom to share one’s problem).Dr Sunil Pandey, state mental health nodal officer, had earlier said, “The idea behind Mann Kaksh is to create a common platform for psychologists or counsellors providing services under varied programmes. Counselling sessions for mental illnesses, alcohol and drug abuse, tobacco control and marital discord will be provided here. The psychiatrist appointed under National Mental Health Programme will manage the centre. The centre will also make sure that the privacy of patients is maintained.’’"

"TB Control Programme: Aadhaar, bank information must for TB patients to draw monthly aid",2018-06-13,BENGALURU,"News,City News,Bengaluru News","BENGALURU: Aadhaar has been made mandatory for those TB patients drawing nutritional aid of Rs 500 per month during their course of treatment. In order to streamline direct benefit transfer (DBT) where money is credited to the beneficiary’s account, the state government has sought Aadhaar card and bank account details of the patients.Dr Ramachandra Bairy, deputy director, TB control programme health and family welfare department , said 83,000 patients in Karnataka have benefited from the scheme in 2017-18 and this year.“We aim to cover 90,000 TB patients in the current year. Once a patient is tested positive for TB, his/her Aadhaar number and bank account details are collected and updated in the system. The Rs 500 per month provided for nutritional aid directly goes to the patient. For a new case, it is given for six months which is the treatment period. For retreatment of old cases, aid is given for eight months. For those suffering from drug-resistant TB, the money is credited as long as they are under treatment,” he said.The health ministry directives mention that the state government should make special arrangements for bedridden, differently abled and senior citizens to get enrolled for Aadhaar in case if they haven’t. “If the patient hasn’t enrolled, the onus is on state governments to make sure s/ he gets enrolled within six months of the treatment period,” said Dr Bairy.On May 29, 2018, the Union ministry of Ayush issued a memorandum to all state governments on use of Aadhaar in benefit schemes and also explained how to handle exceptions. But activists working closely with HIV patients, most of whom also suffer from TB, say the monetary benefits are yet to reach them.“Aadhaar has been made mandatory everywhere, even to receive the crucial anti-retro viral therapy (ART). Tuberculosis affects many HIV patients and left with no other choice, they have given their Aadhaar card details to the government. But we are yet to hear from members about receiving Rs 500 per month as nutrition supplement,” said Chandrika, outreach worker, Milana, a family support network of people suffering from HIV/AIDS"

Humble mussel holds the answer to viral diseases,2018-06-15,PANAJI,"News,City News,Goa News","PANAJI: The green mussel ( Perna viridis ), a delicacy much popular among locals as well as tourists, finds favour with scientists at the Goa-based National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) for its pharmaceutical potential. The scientists have developed and patented a product derived from the shellfish that has very effective anti-viral properties, including against HIV “In 2001, we screened the green mussel against malaria and developed a product called mussel hydrolysate (MuHy) from the meat of the shellfish. A patent for it was filed in collaboration with different institutions in India,” said former NIO scientist Dr Anil Chatterji.In 2006, the product was licenced for Rs 2 crore to an Indian company for commercial production.“Isolation of new compounds from green mussel will help in developing new and effective drugs at prices that are affordable for the common man,” senior scientist at NIO, Dr R A Sreepada said, adding that, so far, no attempt has been made to produce any kind of drug from green mussel.“MuHy is also very active against HIV, tuberculosis and osteoporosis ,” Chatterji said. Elaborating on the action of the product on HIV Sreepada said, “There are two types of anti-HIV drugs, each having a different target. MuHy, a kind of therapeutic agent, hits both targets.”The product is a result of a joint research NIO had conducted with the Russian St Petersburg Pasteur Institute in 2001. At the time, through a collaborative programme, Russians scientists taught their NIO counterparts how to explore the pharmaceutical potential of green mussel extracts.Russia’s coastal belt is blessed with an abundance of blue mussels, the MuHy of which was proven to have preventive and therapeutic properties in tackling influenza virus. It was this critical find that led the Russian scientists to India.Sreepada said that together they checked the efficacy of the MuHy on various viruses in India and discovered that the green mussels of Goa have anti-viral compounds just like their blue counterparts in Russia.“In Russia, MuHy has a very big market and is sold for human and animal use,” Sreepada said.Sadly, in Goa, naturally growing mussels are being plucked at a juvenile stage by fishermen owing to demand by the tourism industry thus leading to depletion of this shellfish resource in the state. “Mussels are also being impacted by habitat degradation due to various reasons. There should be steady efforts made for the large scale expansion of mussel culture in the state,” NIO director Dr Sunil Kumar Singh said.For this, he advised that Goa has to develop hatcheries for green mussel culture. This way, fish farmers can have year-round spats or seeds of mussel instead of waiting for the annual season for sustainable large scale production."

Now, Mohini aims to pursue a PhD in public administration. Chief judicial magistrate Dr Gurpreet Kaur, a PhD scholar herself, has avowed her support to Mohini to pursue her studies.Mohini says the fire to study burns bright in her mind from a young age. For Mohini, she herself is her inspiration. “I have a dream to be well educated. Also, I enjoy studies. Knowleged fills my life with dignity and pride,” she says. “I would love to work towards improving the lives of the members of my community. I want to ensure there is inclusivity and equality. If I get a job somewhere, I will be happy to do it.”Mohini’s story does not end here.In 2012, she registered an NGO in Ferozepur, called Mansa Foundation Welfare Society. The NGO operates in Ludhiana and pays special focus to the needs of transgenders, particularly in the areas of health and social wellbeing. Mohini registered 1,200 transgenders with the HIV/AIDS Alliance India. Of these, 700 transgenders underwent a test for HIV/AIDS. The ones who tested positive for the virus, were taken to doctors and medical practitioners for treatment.When asked about problems faced by transgenders in Ludhiana, Mohini points to a total lack of social inclusivity. “We have no legal or human rights . Some don’t even consider us humans,” she says.Mohini says the community is not allowed education and few benefits trackle down to them. “We are rejected by government officials. There are no health facilities for us and even NGOs turn us back at times,” she says.Mohini says doctors and NGOs did want to be associated with the community. “We are not hired for jobs and are left to survive on beggary. Poverty pushes us into the vicious cycle of prostitution. Our rapes are not recognized by law, so we have no avenue to find justice,” she says.But Mohini is optimistic and hopeful. She believes a workshop conducted by her society, Chandigarh’s Humsafar Trust, and Ludhiana District Legal Services Authority is the first step towards inclusion in mainstream society. “The workshop is aimed at rehabilitating transgenders into the mainstream by imparting them with information on legal rights, health facilities, skill development, and banking facilities available to them,” she says."
Mr Gay World: Kolkata: Researcher wins hearts at Mr Gay World contest,2018-05-29,KOLKATA,"News,City News,Kolkata News","KOLKATA: A cancer researcher from the city emerged the second runner-up in this year’s Mr Gay World , held at Knysna in South Africa . The crown went to Australia’s Jordan Bruno while the first runner-up was Ricky Devine-White from New Zealand.Samarpan Maiti, a 29-yearold student of bio-chemistry who is waiting for his PhD degree on brain cancer from a reputable central institute with his thesis, surprised the jury with his performance at the contest. Maiti made it to the final round after winning the Mr Gay World India 2018, which was held in Mumbai in January.The interview round turned out to be the toughest for Maiti. He was asked how he could champion the cause of the LGBTQ+ community in spite of being “shy” in nature. “I am not outspoken, but I can protest when it is necessary to do so. Moreover, I am patient, which is a quality of a leader, so I can lead the LGBTQ+ community in India where they are still stigmatised,” was Maiti’s reply.He was also asked how he could change people’s perception about HIV/AIDS as often it is shown that LGBTQ+ community is responsible for spreading the disease. “My answer was simple: I will change campaign. HIV sperads from mother to baby as well. So don’t blame the LGBTQ+ community alone.” He also impressed the jury with his social work.“We were taken to a reserve forest and we had to answer questions based on information provided by our guides. Ten of the written questions were based on day-long activities while rest 10 were based on LGBTQ+ awareness. We were even taken to a forest for social work. It was damaged by wildfire and I suggested ways to conserve it.”To take part in the contest was not that easy for the village boy of Panskura. Moreover, though his colleagues and staffers supported him, he was unwilling to divulge the name of his research institute. “My mother Sushama Maiti, a primary schoolteacher, encouraged me knowing I was competing for Mr Gay World and wanted me to be the winner.” He also thanked Sushant Divgikar for mentoring him for the event.Gavin Prins, a publicist and judge in the competition, said: “There were 18 Mr Gays from around the world who participated in the contest and Maiti did really well. India can be very proud of him. Hope Indian people support him in his work to create awareness.”"

"HIV: In 2018’s first trimester, 1 HIV+ person detected per day",2018-06-04,PANAJI,"News,City News,Goa News,Civic Issues","PANAJI: Ninety-two people tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) in Goa in the first three months of 2018, translating into one case being detected each day. This is a significant improvement from a decade ago, when over two HIV+ cases were recorded per day.While men constituted 60% of the total number of HIV+ cases in the first trimester of this year, no transgenders and transsexuals were detected with the condition for the second year in a row.Mormugao continued to be the taluka with the highest number of HIV+ cases (27%), while Salcete came in second at 16%. Bardez, the taluka that had in the past years reported the second-highest and, sometimes, highest number of HIV+ cases in the state, accounted for only six of the total cases in the first three months of 2018. No new cases were reported from Sattari, Sanguem and Canacona.The predominant mode of transmission of HIV has continued to be the sexual route, with over 90% of such cases reported. Transmission modes involving infected syringes, needles, blood and blood products have been negligible in the state.Although five deaths due to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in January and February this year, chief medical officer of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), Dr Chandrakant Parab, said the launch of the ‘test and treat’ policy last April is expected to reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths further. Under the policy, anyone diagnosed as an HIV+ patient is put on antiretroviral therapy (ART), irrespective of the clinical stage or CD4 count—a snapshot of how the patient’s immune system is functioning. In the past, ART, which suppresses the activity of the HIV retrovirus, was recommended only in cases where it was considered necessary.Since the implementation of the ‘test and treat’ policy, more than 370 HIV+ persons have been put on ART in a phased manner in the state.“ART, which can slow down the rate at which HIV weakens the immune system, is now administered to everybody: Men, women, adolescents and children,” Parab said, pointing out that the move is expected to keep their immune system strong and healthy and improve their longevity and quality of life.Parab said the elimination of stigma is vital to ensure that people who have the slightest doubt of their status voluntarily come forward to get tested and seek treatment. “Those indulging in risky behaviour must also protect themselves, as HIV is 100% preventable,” he added."
Indian-American indicted for multi-million dollar fraud scheme in US,2018-06-16,NEW YORK,"News,BUSINESS NEWS,India Business News","NEW YORK: An Indian-American former president of a blood-testing company along with its founder has been charged in the US for allegedly engaging in a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud investors, doctors and patients by making false claims about the accuracy of their much-hyped testing devices.Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, 53 and Elizabeth Holmes , 34 were charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud and appeared yesterday before US Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen in San Jose for their initial appearances, Acting United States Attorney Alex Tse said.According to the indictment unsealed yesterday, the charges stem from allegations Holmes and Balwani engaged in a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud investors, and a separate scheme to defraud doctors and patients. Both schemes involved efforts to promote Palo Alto-based company Theranos.Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 as a private health care and life sciences company aimed at revolutionizing medical laboratory testing through allegedly innovative methods for drawing blood, testing blood, and interpreting the resulting patient data.Balwani, a former boyfriend of Holmes, was employed at Theranos from September of 2009 through 2016. At times during that period, Balwani worked in several capacities including as a member of the company's board of directors, as its president, and as its chief operating officer.According to the indictment, Holmes and Balwani used advertisements and solicitations to encourage and induce doctors and patients to use Theranos's blood testing laboratory services, even though they knew Theranos was not capable of consistently producing accurate and reliable results for certain blood tests.The tests performed on Theranos technology, in addition, were likely to contain inaccurate and unreliable results.The indictment alleges that the two used a combination of direct communications, marketing materials, statements to the media, financial statements, models, and other information to defraud potential investors.Specifically, they claimed that Theranos developed a revolutionary and proprietary analyzer, which could perform a full range of clinical tests using small blood samples drawn from a finger stick. Holmes and Balwani represented that the analyzer could produce results that were more accurate and reliable than those yielded by conventional methods--all at a faster speed than previously possible.Holmes and Balwani knew that many of their representations about the analyzer were false and that the analyzer had accuracy and reliability problems, performed a limited number of tests, was slower than some competing devices, and, in some respects, could not compete with existing, more conventional machines.Authorities said Holmes and Balwani not only defrauded investors, but also consumers who trusted and relied upon their allegedly-revolutionary blood-testing technology.""This indictment alleges a corporate conspiracy to defraud financial investors,"" Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent in Charge John Bennett said.""This conspiracy misled doctors and patients about the reliability of medical tests that endangered health and lives.""The indictment further alleges that Holmes and Balwani defrauded doctors and patients by making false claims concerning Theranos's ability to provide accurate, fast, reliable, and cheap blood tests and test results, and through omissions concerning the limits of and problems with Theranos's technologies.The defendants knew that Theranos was not capable of consistently producing accurate and reliable results for certain blood tests, including the tests for calcium, chloride, potassium, bicarbonate, HIV and sodium.The duo also allegedly made numerous misrepresentations to potential investors about Theranos's financial condition and its future prospects.They represented to investors that Theranos conducted its patients' tests using Theranos-manufactured analyzers; when, in truth, Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos purchased and used for patient testing third party, commercially-available analyzers.The defendants also represented to investors that Theranos would generate over $100 million in revenues and break even in 2014 and that Theranos expected to generate approximately $1 billion in revenues in 2015 when, in truth, the defendants knew Theranos would generate only negligible or modest revenues in 2014 and 2015."

HIV: More horror hubs: Rehab home inmates cry torture,2018-06-18,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Hyderabad News,Crime","HYDERABAD: If the state of affairs at the government-run mental hospital in Hyderabad came as a shocker, the city’s illegal rehabilitation and de-addiction centres might be an even scarier prospect for many. These centres are becoming hubs for physical and mental torture. Inmates allege that they are beaten up and tortured by the staff. They say they are crammed in dark and dingy rooms and go through a traumatic time.With no proper scanner, the addiction treatment industry has become fairly unregulated with little oversight into the daily practices that take place at the illegal facilities, activists said.Sharing his ordeal, K Anand, an inmate from Kukatpally, said, “The inmates are treated worse than criminals at these illegal rehabilitation centres. I was not even allowed to talk to my family. I once slit my wrist thinking that this act of mine would prompt them to let me speak to my relatives. I sometimes felt it would have been better had they put me in a jail instead of a deaddiction centre.”Anand who is now waging a campaign against de-addiction centres says how most of them do not even have a qualified psychiatrist to treat addicts and they get away because of lack of effective monitoring mechanisms. Anand further explained how the inmates are beaten up with pipes, stuffed along with others into small rooms, made to clean an entire floor with a toothbrush or made to sit facing a wall without food and water for an entire day.“There are several cases where the inmates, unable to bear the torture, commit suicide,” Anand said.Another victim of such extreme torture was G Venkateshwar Rao. He was locked up in a de-addiction centre, refused food and denied even a call to his mother.He says he felt like a dead man for about eight years. For him, the battle was just not against the alleged torture in the six or seven de-addiction centres where he was shunted about, but also against an HIV infection and devastating tuberculosis blight.R Rajendra Prasad, father of a former addict, says, “Those admitted to these centres already have a problem. Why should we hurt them further? My son and many others were locked in dark rooms for days together, beaten, abused, and were kept away from their families.” He added that some of the centres have a licence for 15 or 30 beds, but they admit over 100 people.Dr Uma Shankar, superintendent, Institute of Mental Health, said, “Earlier, we had no permission from the government to inspect these places. It is still difficult to stop unauthorised de-addiction centres because even if their license was cancelled, they start a new centre with a new name in a different place”."

Congratulations are in order for the property owners who have risen above such evidently widespread — but completely unfounded — prejudice. We hope the rest of the city learns from this; these kids deserve all our support in their struggle.

KOLKATA: Cafe Positive, a dream of 10 HIV-positive teenagers, has finally found an address.The 12ft-by-10ft garage at Jodhpur Park was finalised after a six-month search for space in some of south Kolkata’s posh localities yielded a straightaway “no” from house-owners when they learnt about who will manage and run the shop.At 524 Jodhpur Park, a senior official of a leading national ayurvedic firm and an honorary member of Rotary Club of Calcutta has offered his garage space to the teenagers from where they plan to start the café in July. “I was initially a bit hesitant to offer my garage space as it is much smaller than what they were looking for. But after learning that they had failed to manage any space in over six months, I told them to start their business from here. This can be the beginning from where they can spread their wings. I am happy to be a part of this noble initiative,” said Indrajyoti Dasgupta.Dasgupta, who has moved his car out of the garage for the café, is yet to find an alternate parking space.TOI had reported on March 5 how six boys and four girls, who have undergone training in baking, sandwich-making and coffee and mocktail preparations, aspired to start their own coffee shop at some location in south Kolkata but were turned down by house-owners.“We faced strange reasons from people for refusing space to these kids. While some said their family members were not ready, others said people in the neighbourhood wouldn’t allow them to run a business with HIV-positive patients. But we are thankful to have finally found space. It is a much smaller space than what we were looking for, but at least the kids can start from here,” said Kallol Ghosh, founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for abandoned HIV/AIDS-infected children at Narendrapur.N GO Anandaghar will give the initial funds and later hand over the management of the café to the 10 youths, who would be running it.The café is scheduled to start from July 14, coinciding with Rath Yatra. “We will begin with an assortment of hot and cold coffees, mocktails and mojitos, and at least four types of cakes, veg and non-veg sandwiches and cookies. For now, we will bank more on takeaway service till we get a bigger place with a larger seating capacity,” said Susanta Pal (name changed), one of the 10 youths.“It has been a long wait. At one time, we thought we would never get space for our shop after being rejected by several house-owners. But now that we have finally managed one, I am happy and looking forward to a better future. We will be able to wipe off the taboos associated with the disease we suffer from with day-to-day interaction with our customers,” said Sathi Biswas (name changed), another member."
‘State failed to release Rs 323-cr fund’,2018-06-18,Thiruvananthapuram,,"Thiruvananthapuram: The CAG report on social sector for the year ending 2017, which was tabled in the assembly, pointed out serious deficiencies in providing delivery services to women, setting up facilities for infants at delivery points and the shortfall in infrastructure.It also found that the state hadn’t released its share of the National Health Mission (NHM) funds allotted by the Centre from 2012 to 2017. The audit observed that the state failed to release Rs 323.22 crore during this period and this was not communicated to the Centre. Though guidelines stipulate that state share should be increased every year, there was no information on the increase in the state’s expenditure corresponding to the central expenditure.The report pointed out that caesarean procedures in Kerala were way above the national average. Against the national average of 17.2%, data obtained from the directorate of health services showed that 40-42% of deliveries in Kerala were C-sections in the said period. “The government accepted that the state average (of C-section deliveries) was high and admitted that it was a shameful situation,” the report said.Other major findings of the report are that over 12% of 24.95 lakh pregnant women – who registered for antenatal care – did not receive iron and folic acid tablets. There was shortfall in the percentage of women who received tetanus toxoid shots. It also found that 37% of 24.95 lakh pregnant women were not tested for HIV. Delivery facilities were available only in 15 of the test-checked 65 institutions in select districts like Wayanad, Malappuram, Thrissur and Alappuzha."
Recurring pain can be first sign of sickle cell disease,2018-06-19,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Hyderabad News,Civic Issues","HYDERABAD: Advising patients to watch out for periodic episodes of pain, called ‘crises’, doctors say these are a major symptom of sickle cell anaemia. Other warning signs include fatigue, fever and unexplained swelling, they said while speaking on the occasion of World Sickle Cell Day.Doctors say sickle cell anaemia, caused by a mutation in the haemoglobin-Beta gene, can bring with it a host of consequences from strokes and organ damage to vision problems and eventual blindness. Awareness needs to be created about the disease to bring down morbidity rates associated with it in the city, say doctors.“A fatal stroke can occur if sickle cells block blood flow to an area of your brain. Sickle cell anaemia can also cause life-threatening complications like acute chest syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, organ damage, leg ulcers and gallstones. Sickle cells can also block the tiny blood vessel that are connected to one’s eyes. Over time, this can damage the retina and lead to blindness,” warned Dr Sonali Ashok Sadawarte, consultant haemato-oncologist and bone marrow transplant physician at KIMS Hospitals in Secunderabad.Doctors also point out how patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia often require recurring blood transfusions, making them at risk of contracting diseases such as HIV Hepatitis B and C and Malaria, from unscreened blood.“There is an urgent need to create awareness on the disease and the prevention measures given that the only cure is bone marrow transplantation, in cases where the patient has managed to find a matching donor. Hence tests like carrier screening, new born screening and pre-natal diagnosis, which help in early diagnosis and prevention, should be made accessible. It is also very important to provide genetic counselling to patients before even offering them any advice to enable them to understand the disease, implications and management,” said Dr Rahul Agarwal, consultant, internal medicine at MaxCure Hospitals in Madhapur."
Quota to be sought for sickle cell patients,2018-06-20,NAGPUR,"News,City News,Nagpur News","NAGPUR: The problems people suffering from sickle cell disease face will be taken up with the government in right earnest and efforts made to get it recognized so that various facilities could be made available to them, said Dr Uday Bodhankar, president of Commonwealth Association for Health and Disability, on Tuesday.Besides seeking official recognition to the sickle cell disease on the lines of polio and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the issue of giving these patients reservation in education and jobs will be pursued with the government, Dr Bodhankar said. He was speaking at a programme organized by Sickle Cell Society of India at Mor Bhavan, Sitabuldi.The event was held to mark World Sickle Cell Day and create awareness about the disease.In his address, Dr Ganju said the sickle cell disease should be eradicated as early as possible as over 50 lakh sufferers are leading a painful life in India. The disease is transferred from parents to child. If both are carriers of these genes, the child becomes a victim of this life-threatening disease. Constant hydration, avoiding exhaustion and improving supply of oxygen to body are therefore important for such patients, he added.Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder wherein red blood cells of the patient morph and take the shape of a sickle. These misshapen cells then have trouble freely moving around the blood stream and often clot and get stuck, causing extreme pain to the patient which can lead to life-threatening condition. This disease has no cure as of today, and the only relief from it is medicines and painkillers.Jaya, wife of Padma Shri recipient Sampat Ramteke, who founded the society, said her husband championed the cause of sickle cell patients after their son was diagnosed with the disease and worked hard for government to recognize this as a serious disease like polio and AIDS. She has been continuing her husband’s mission even after his death.(Reporting by Ritika Gupta)"

They will be allotted one booth in every ward in the Jaipur city.Chief minister Vasundhara Raje had declared that 5,000 dairy booths will be opened in the state for the women out of which 1,000 will be in Jaipur city. This will be done to empower women and to raise employment opportunities for them.Along with this, there are even plans to open a single window for licensing in the JMC office as the complaints of the public towards the authorities related to the issue of licensing for dairy booths are rising in number.This plan is made to keep a check on the officials so that problem will not be created for the general public. Jaipur city is divided into eight zones and at present in every zone a junior engineer (JEN) look after the matter but after the implementation of single window, soon two JEN and two clerks will look after the matters of four zones each in the office to be allotted in the JMC.Mayor Ashok Lahoti said, “The decision to open a single window is taken to make the licensing scheme more transparent. There is a plan to open 1,000 new dairy booths in the city and new licenses will be given only to the ladies as per the social welfare scheme announced by the chief minister Vasundhara Raje. In all the 91 wards, we have planned to give one dairy booth to the women suffering from AIDS, cancer or is a widow, to help them earn a decent living.”To increase the competition in the state regarding the milk sale JMC has even planned to give 100 booths to the Amul dairy which will also be the company’s first entry in Rajasthan The chairman of the licensing committee Mahesh Kalwani told TOI that the proposal for single window for licensing is made to give proper shape to the plans of chief minister Vasundhara Raje. “I have met many people who have complained about the red tap-ism and corruption that is rampant during the time of license issuing.

Life like 3D mini brains for drug testing developed,2018-05-30,WASHINGTON,News,"WASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a life like 3D mini brain containing all six major cell types found in normal organs including neurons and immune cells that could help study diseases and tests new drugs.In a study published in the journal 'Scientific Reports', researchers reported that their advanced 3D organoids promote the formation of a fully cell based, natural and functional barrier - the blood brain barrier that mimics normal human anatomy.The blood brain barrier is a semipermeable membrane that separates the circulating blood from the brain, protecting it from foreign substances that could cause injury.This development is important because the model can help to further understanding of disease mechanisms at the blood brain barrier, the passage of drugs through the barrier, and the effects of drugs once they cross the barrier.""The shortage of effective therapies and low success rate of investigational drugs are due in part because we do not have a human-like tissue models for testing,"" said Anthony Atala, director of Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine (WFIRM) in the US.""The development of tissue engineered 3D brain tissue equivalents such as these can help advance the science toward better treatments and improve patients' lives,"" said Atala.The development of the model opens the door to speedier drug discovery and screening, both for neurological conditions and for diseases like HIV where pathogens hide in the brain and avoid current treatments that cannot cross the blood brain barrier.It may also allow for disease modeling of neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson 's disease so that researchers can better understand their pathways and progression.Thus far the researchers have used the brain organoids to mimic strokes in order to measure impairment of the blood brain barrier and have successfully tested the model's permeability with large and small molecules.""Using an engineered tissue model provides a platform that can be used to understand the fundamental principles at play with the blood brain barrier and its function, as well as the effects of chemical substances that cross it,"" said Goodwell Nzou , a PhD candidate at WFIRM."

State takes a leaf from ‘Udta Punjab’ for de-addiction ideas,2018-06-23,AHMEDABAD,"News,City News,Ahmedabad News,Civic Issues","AHMEDABAD: While the menace of drugs is worrying sections of society in Gujarat, as its discreet tentacles spread among the youth, state-based experts decided to turn to Punjab, a state with a high rate of the population undergoing rehabilitation, to understand how intervention can be planned and what strategies can be employed to counter the drug menace.A workshop was organized by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) in Ahmedabad from June 18 to 22 as part of Unified Budget, Results and Accountability Framework (UBRAF) project where experts included psychiatrists from AIIMS and Punjab’s AIDS Control Society.Dr Rajesh Gopal, joint director of GSACS, said that the idea was to strengthen state-based intervention centres — two located in Surat and one in Ahmedabad — with special focus on opioid substitution treatment (OST). “A team from Gujarat had recently visited rehabilitation and intervention centres in Punjab. They shared their learning with the participants. One of the major thrust areas is community outreach and timely help,” he said. The team that visited Punjab said that the first lesson is acceptance of the issue and readiness to change the situation. The majority of addicts are in the working age group and there is overwhelming number of men addicted to natural and synthetic drugs. Experts also pointed out that instead of taking patients completely off drugs, they devise a programme that gradually decreases the dosage. Madhu Sharma, national programme officer for India, UNODC, said that they have involved all stakeholders in the fight against drugs. “The training will not only enable intervention centres to improve techniques but will also reach social workers, NGOs and families. Psychiatrists, de-addiction specialists and those implementing national and local intervention programmes participated,” she said."
HIV: Most people with STDs in country are from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh,2018-06-23,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Hyderabad News","HYDERABAD: Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have reported the highest number of people with sexually-transmitted diseases in the country, according to National Health Profile of India 2018.The report says, in 2016 around 8,056 cases of syphilis, that amount to 35 per cent of total cases, was reported in Telangana alone. In 2017, Andhra Pradesh reported the highest number of syphilis cases: around 5,155. For gonorrhoea, Telangana reported the highest number of cases (19,884) followed by AP in 2016; in 2017 AP recorded highest in the country.Centre has released the report on the health profile of various states on June 19. Health experts disagree with the Centre.Robotic urologist and microsurgical andrologist Dr Kammela Sridhar said, “Promiscuity is high in the two states. Genital hygiene and nonuse of condom and improper use of condom are general factors. Homosexuality has increased. The risk of transmitting STDs and HIV is 16 times more in homosexuals.”According to National Health Profile of India 2018, Telangana and AP have reported the highest number of people with sexually-transmitted diseases in India.Robotic urologist and microsurgical andrologist Dr Kammela Sridhar said, “In Telangana and AP obesity is highest in the country. Due to fat in the body, the immune system is less effective. Due to heavy sweating, particularly in AP coast, genital hygiene is affected. Tamil Nadu has worked well to bring down STDs and HIV.”However, dermatologists say figures by Union health ministry should be relooked into and could be defective.Dermatologist Dr George Valsan of Sarada Hospital in Sainikpuri says, “We have been receiving a number of cases of syphilis and gonococcal infections. In 8,000-10,000 patients, I get two or three cases of gonorrhoea a year. Syphilis has also drastically increased. Around 4-5 cases are reported a month. Maybe, more cases are reported in government hospitals. But the figures put out by the Centre should be revisited. HIV infections are there. Almost 65% are fungal infections like candidiasis, and viral infections like herpes simplex have increased.”In January 2018, an Osmania and Gandhi Medical College and ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute, Pune, study found that multi-drug resistant strains of gonorrhoea were seen. At least 20 cases in Secunderabad and 16 in Hyderabad, verified by researchers, were found. A total of 98% isolates of gonorrhoea were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 52% to penicillin, 56% tetracycline and 5% azithromycin.AP also recorded highest number of acute respiratory infection deaths and cases after UP. In 2017, due to acute respiratory infections, 324 people died in AP and 26 in Telangana."
chinese cancer warriors: Chinese cancer warriors to get helping hand from India,2018-07-10,BEIJING,"News,India News","BEIJING: Days after the release of the Chinese movie ‘Dying to Survive’, based on the real-life story of a leukaemia patient who smuggled cheap anti-cancer drugs from India for people who could not afford expensive western drugs, the two countries have reached an agreement on reduction of tariffs on the import of Indian medicines, particularly cancer drugs, to China.“We believe expansion of imports and slashing of tariffs on anti-cancer medicines will usher in great opportunities for India and other countries in the region,” said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying on Monday. Last May, China lifted tariffs on the import of cancer drugs. But the move did not excite the Indian industry because they need licenses and tendering support from government hospitals to sell the drugs in China. This kind of support was not forthcoming until now. It is not clear if the foreign ministry is referring to the decision last May or this is a new development.Other details about the extent of tariff cuts and types of anti-cancer drugs and sources of drugs that would be affected were also not immediately available from official sources.It is possible that Beijing will encourage Indian companies to establish manufacturing of anti-cancer drugs, particularly those that are off patents, in China instead of depending on imports. China has allowed some Indian companies to establish production facilities from medicines to covering other diseases but no licence has been given to them for anticancer drug manufacturing.About 4.3 million people are diagnosed with cancer annually in China, according to a report of the state-run China Central Television . While announcing the agreement, Hua also referred to the film. ‘Dying to Survive’ is based on Lu Yong, a leukaemia patient, was himself inspired by the Oscar-winning film ‘Dallas Buyers Club’, which is also based on a reallife story of an AIDS patient called Ron Woodroof who smuggled unapproved drugs into Texas to treat himself and others. 'Dying to Survive', which was partly shot in Mumbai, opened with a massive $151 million and its total collection by Sunday stood fractionally short of $200 million, according to a popular website tracking movie business.Between 2006 and 2013, Lu helped hundreds of chronic myeloid leukemia patients buy a generic drug produced in India for around 200 yuan ($30) per month, which claims to be as effective as the foreign drug but costs more than 20,000 yuan (over $3,100) each month. However, it is not yet clear from Monday’s announcement whether China has agreed to grant licence to Indian companies to sell cancer drugs in the Chinese market, which could be a major step. Indian companies cannot legally market their drugs in China as it requires a licence from the country’s food and drug administration."

Patient group opposes Gilead’s hep C drug patents,2018-07-11,MUMBAI,"News,BUSINESS NEWS,India Business News","MUMBAI: Delhi Network of Positive People (DNP+), a patient advocacy and support group, has challenged additional patent claims by Gilead Sciences for two hepatitis C medicines before the Mumbai Patent Office. With these applications, DNP+ hopes to prevent the US pharma major from obtaining patent rights on sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, which would allow Gilead to continue charging exorbitant prices from countries across the world.These oppositions challenge Gilead’s patent applications for the tablet formulation of fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and the polymorph form of velpatasvir, a statement from medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières MSF ) said.The grounds for these patent oppositions are based on provisions in the Indian Patents Act that prevent patent ‘evergreening’ — which restricts the patentability of a host of secondary patents, i.e., new forms of known substances, new property or new use of known substances, use of known processes without showing any enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and admixtures without synergistic effect.Hepatitis C continues to remain a significant public health issue in low- and middle-income countries, which account for roughly 72% of the over 70 million people infected worldwide. In 2016, Gilead Sciences launched sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in the US at over $74,000 for a 12-week regimen.Paul Lhungdim of DNP+ said, “Just like Gilead attempted to patent different forms and combinations of the key HIV drug tenofovir many years back, the corporation is again using evergreening tactics to block affordable options of hep C drugs that other countries can import in the future.With these patent challenges, we hope to prevent Gilead from obtaining unmerited patent rights on sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, which would allow them to continue charging exorbitant prices from governments in many middle- and high-income countries.”Earlier, Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge ( I-MAK ), along with the DNP+, had challenged the basic patent claims on sofosbuvir in 2013 through pre-grant oppositions. The issue remains under dispute before the Delhi high court and Intellectual Property Appellate Board In February 2017, I-MAK and DNP+ had also challenged the basic patent claim on velpatasvir, asserting that the drug is an obvious structural change to an earlier hepatitis C drug ledipasvir, and thus, cannot be patented. A decision is now awaited.DNP+’s oppositions are based on India’s patent law, which allows third parties, including civil society organisations, to file ‘pre-grant’ oppositions to challenge patent applications until the patent is rejected or granted by the Indian Patent Office.Such ‘evergreening’ tactics allow the company to extend their control over the market, in turn delaying the introduction of affordable generic drugs and patient access to treatment in a number of countries, the note said."

Some of them went away on Monday, while the rest of them moved on Tuesday. While doctors at the centre claimed the addicts went on their own, the Congress MP suspected foul play by the psychiatrist at the centre, and claimed he would seek an inquiry in the case. Bittu claimed they had got half of them admitted at the drug de-addiction centre in Mullanpur again.A total of nine drug addicts were brought to the Civil Hospital for treatment. Bittu had even taken responsibility for the daily expenses of the centre. However, hospital staff had shown reluctance even at that time, while highlighting the shortage of beds at the centre, and lack of security, as some of the addicts were of a notorious nature.Psychologist Dr Vivek Goyal informed that the addicts did not want to stay there at the drug de-addiction centre, and promised to come back for regular check-ups in the OPD. So, he had called upon their relatives and sent them back. He said he could not keep anybody forcefully at the drug de-addiction centre, and if they did not want to stay there, he was supposed to send them back.However, Bittu alleged that he was informed by the relatives of drug addicts that the staff at the centre did not give them proper diet and medicine, which created unrest among the addicts. He said it was a matter of investigation, as to how all the nine had expressed a desire to go back, and instead of sending them back, the doctor should have informed him. “I am going to seek an inquiry against the doctor by writing a letter to health minister Brahm Mohindra. There will be action against the persons responsible,” he said, while adding that Congress leaders had got five out of the nine re-admitted to a drug de-addiction centre in Mullanpur.Meanwhile AAP MLA from Dakha constituency HS Phoolka though welcomed the initiative by Congress MP Ravneet Bittu but adviced him to work at the grassroot level. ""There is alarming situation and all parties should work together."" But he also gave him advice to work on ground level for bringing positive results for betterment of public.13 OUT OF 29 FOUND HIV+Congress MP Ravneet Bittu informed that they had brought around 29 drug addicts from various villages in the past two days for drug de-addiction. He said they were examined medically, and out of 29, 13 were found HIV+. He said the situation was so alarming, that by sharing syringes, these patients were moving towards deadly diseases like AIDS."

Director of Rajya Shiksha Kendra (RSK), Lokesh Kumar Jatav, said: “Since this is a sensitive issue, we are taking all possible steps to protect the identity of such students. We will not reveal their disease to the schools they are admitted.”According to RTE rules, private schools need to reserve 25% seats for children belonging to economically weaker sections and disadvantaged groups. In May last year, Supreme Court had asked all states to include HIV+ kids in disadvantaged category — regardless of financial background — and give them RTE benefits. When admission season opened this year, parents of HIV+ children filed applications and after the final lottery on Tuesday, 68 names came up.Asked why it wasn’t implemented last year, soon after the SC order, Jatav said the state had to amendments to add the new provision. “We will ensure that no HIV-affected child is left out,” he said. “He said, “All children living with or affected by HIV in Madhya Pradesh are now entitled to special protections and measures under RTE Act. He refused to disclose how many such applications were filed. The law bars schools from discriminating against HIV+ children, denying access to benefits, or segregating them in study, sports, playground, and canteen areas. SC’s landmark decision provided relief to nearly 3 lakh HIV-afflicted children in the country."

The reason we did this is the law is also used to prosecute child sexual abuse (at the time there was no POCSO) and bestiality.A common question is: How many gay people get prosecuted under this law? Clearly, not many but it hangs as Damocles’ sword over their heads. It is used by a highly corrupt police force to harass gay men, and the reason they can do this is because many are not out to their families and police play on these fears. This law did not allow for information on HIV prevention to be made available to the community.It’s been a long journey with many ups and downs. The one good thing is many joined us on the way, which ultimately resulted in a very progressive judgment by the Delhi high court in 2009 decriminalising homosexuality. It opened the door for many young people to be open about their sexuality. Unfortunately, there was a setback when a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court set aside the Delhi high court judgment in 2013. This came as a shock to the community because in effect it asked people to go back into the closet. This was not possible for those who took this courageous stand.This was evidenced by the present petition, which has been submitted by five wellknown gay people. There are other petitions too, including from parents of gay people. This shows me there is a definite shift in the way this law is being perceived by society and the importance of having it read down.Today, the government itself responded saying they leave it to the courts to make the decision. This is significant because they have shifted from the previous stand of opposing reading down 377. Ideally, now, the hope is the Supreme Court gives a judgment that respects the existence of the LGBTQ community. This still will not guarantee rights most citizens of the country take for granted, like the right to marry or to adopt. That’s another journey and another fight. I hope the court settles this debate so no one is criminalised based on whom they want to love and live with.Anjali Gopalan is executive director, Naz Foundation (India) Trust"

However, psychiatrist Vivek Goel refuted all allegations, and said he was giving them treatment, but they did not want to stay at the hospital. Dr Geeta said: “We will have to inquire and find out the actual picture behind the entire episode. Therefore, I have marked an inquiry in this case.”Earlier, Bittu also met addicts who had come back from Ludhiana Civil Hospital, and were under treatment in Mullanpur now. One of the addicts who left the Civil Hospital said they were not dealt with properly by staff at the hospital, and the doctor was also not performing his duty, so they came back.Meanwhile, the MP visited the villages of Saffipura, Malsian Bajan, and Tihara from where the youngsters were taken to Guru Nanak Hospital in Mullanpur for their treatment. The mother of a 14-year-old drug addict revealed to Bittu that her son was merely 10 years old when he was caught in the web of drug addicts. She said her husband was also an addict who left the house several years ago, and now her son was also moving in the same direction. She rued: “I and my daughter do the labour work, as my son hardly remains in his senses due to the effect of drugs.”Another drug addict shared that there was easy availability of drugs some time back, but now there was strictness in the village, so they were not getting their supplies in time. He said they wanted to get rid of this problem now.Bittu said they had brought 47 youngsters to the drug de-addiction centre in Mullanpur from various villages, and on Wednesday, they visited the villages of Jagraon from where 13 youngsters were taken for treatment to the same centre. He said youngsters from some villages had assured to support them in this task, and they would keep a watch on the movement of drug suppliers in the village, who will be handed over to the police immediately.Meanwhile, District Youth Congress president Rajiv Raja on Wednesday alleged he had taken a drug addict to the de-addiction centre at Civil Hospital for treatment at around 3pm, but despite repeated calls, psychiatrist Dr Vivek Goyal did not reach the centre.

The devices, which are to be installed within three months, record all sonographies which would help clamp down on sex determination tests. The devices have already been installed in many government hospitals.The high court also asked the chief secretary of the state to issue necessary directions to all diagnostic centres in the state to supply a list of all expecting mothers and their due dates to the office of the chief medical officer concerned.

A single gulp of a full bottle of syrup will make them feel flying. Likewise, the drugs injected also will keep them in a sedated state for a long time,"" said consultant neuro-psychiatrist Dr K Ramakrishnan of Athma Hospitals in Trichy. He said that the habit would lead to sudden death or suicide in the long run as rehabilitation could not be possible for chronic patients.The recent case was of the use of Tapentadol by four people. Not only Tapentadol but also several other schedule ‘H’ drugs are being misused by people who want to get high. Cough syrups such as Phensydyl, pentazocine , surgical sprit, aspirin tablet, alprazolam and few other drugs are also used for the purpose. Such persons won’t be bothered about using the same needle among several people in a group to inject the drug. They are prone to infections including HIV The enquiry by ToI with police and doctors revealed that the increasing incidence of youths getting addicted to prescription drugs have become a serious issue in the city. Drug addicts and alcoholics from the district and neighbouring districts frequent deaddiction centres in Trichy.Recently, Thillai Nagar police in Trichy reprimanded an 18-year-old boy for administering himself drugs. Depression, job stress, failure in life were said to be the reasons behind people turning to this habit. Those who underwent surgeries were also prone to drug addiction as they have already experienced the comfort of pain relievers.On the other hand, former assistant director of drugs control, Trichy zone K Chandrasekaran pointed out the rampant violation in the sale of such drugs. ""The over the counter sale at medical shops, unqualified staff at pharmacies, and lending pharmacy certificates to the medical shops should be curbed. Law enforcement by the drug control department should be tightened,"" said Chandrasekaran.Trichy chapter of The Tamil Nadu Chemists and Druggists Association (TNCDA) expressed its displeasure over the violation of some of the medical shop owners.

For this purpose, the government will constitute a ‘Standing National Committee on Medicines’ involving scientists, doctors and experts to “review and revise” the NLEM , and may also include medical devices, disposables and consumables to the list, official sources told TOI.Only cardiac stents from medical devices were included in the NLEM in 2016, following a court order.The development assumes significance as the National List typically forms the basis of price caps extended on essential medicines by the drug prices regulator, as was done in the last revision.Also, this time round, a standing committee with a three-year term has been constituted and will meet every six months to take stock and may also incorporate changes in the essential list.With medical science evolving each day, there was a need for a committee which can take stock and have a longer tenure, the official added.NLEM was last revised in 2015 by a one-time committee formed by the health ministry. The list was expanded to 384 drugs from the existing 348, after which ceiling prices were fixed by NPPA the following year.In the last exercise, though drugs for critical illnesses like cancer, HIV and diabetes were added, many therapies were still missing.The present exercise is expected to make the list more relevant and broad-based with inputs taken from World Health Organisation and Indian Pharmacopoeia, and add drugs included in the national health programmes."
"Homosexuals in city battle social stigma, health issues",2018-07-15,Visakhapatnam,"News,City News,Visakhapatnam News","Visakhapatnam: As a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court continues to hear the case about decriminalising Section 377 (homosexuality) of the Indian Penal Code, psychologists and medical experts in the city point to the urgent need of doing away with the stigma surrounding gay sex – and the various health implications that homosexuals continue to suffer as a result of that stigma.Around 14 cases of young gay men, who visited the AU psychology department in the last six months for counselling, are suffering from depression, and substance abuse as a fallout of the stigma that they have faced for the better part of their lives.In the absence of a support system and acceptance from society, these youths, all in their 20s, are increasingly becoming alienated from society. Due to lack of awareness, they were also found to be engaging in unsafe sex, which is a case for concern.Prof MVR Raju, a professor from AU Psychology department said, “These young adults who come to me for counselling are biologically normal but face social stigma and suffer from lack of acceptance. This has instilled in them a need to adapt to societal demands. Some of them even went to Mumbai to get a sex change operation done so that they could find more acceptance within society.”“Most of them have admitted to substance abuse including binging on alcohol and smoking marijuana. They suffer from depression, phobia of social isolation, lack of support system from family and social stigma. They need counselling, behaviour modification and therapy, education and respectable employment to be absorbed in societal mainstream,” added Prof Raju.Padma Shri awardee physician Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao, who is also a HIV specialist, said at least five to six young gay men in the age bracket of 14-30 years come for consultation. While some are accompanied by parents, others come alone.“I have observed that practice of safe sex is almost absent among gay people. They are at high risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis, venereal warts, herpes and so on. Around 11% of the gay community in the state suffers from HIV too,” the physician said."

The long-distance relationship keeps 34 of them in love.""I plan to set up shops in Ahmedabad and Goa to feature an LGBTQ clothing line, which is often termed as queer, pride or rainbow clothing,"" Shah said. ""Working closely with the LGBTQ community, I learned that there is a huge demand in various states of India for specialized clothing which comforts and complements their ‘different’ body types."" She said her venture aims to introduce LGBTQ lingerie, T-shirts with pride slogans, themed accessories, mugs and formal garments. Much of the inventory will come from overseas. ""This will solve their mundane problem of dressing up because such a clothing line will usher in genderless fashion and styling concepts,"" she said.Abhishek Tundel, 21, who studied at the MSU, is an LGBTQ activist from Gujarat. He opened an event management company last year to plan and execute LGBTQ weddings. Tundel has made arrangements for about 45 LGBTQ notional weddings in various cities of India over the past two years.Tundel, who previously worked in alliance with AGMB, said: ""We get pundits for the ceremonies, counsel parents, and friends of the same-sex couples."" Tundel said that the most difficult part of planning and executing any LGBTQ wedding is counselling the couple’s parents and persuading them to attend the wedding.On being asked about the legitimacy of his work given that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code is still in force, Tundel said, ""We ethically help couples formalize their emotional association or companionship."" What they decide to do in personal life is their private matter, he said. ""This work may be falling in the grey area, but it is not illegal,"" he said. ""We are happy to assist the LGBTQ community which is still fighting for its basic rights in India."" Another Gujarati among these pioneers is Dr Kiran Devmani, 32, a filmmaker whose work ""Meghdhanushya —The Colour of Life"" (2013) highlights the challenges faced by the LGTBQ community. Devmani’s film is the first Gujarati movie on the plight of the LGBTQ community; yet it was not given the 100% tax exemption. A case demanding the exemption is under way.Devmani said that there is no law that prohibits making of a film on homosexuality and hence the government’s refusal to grant the exemption was invalid.The world’s first royal who brought homosexuality out of the closet is Gujarat’s Manvendrasingh Gohil, the gay prince from Vadodara, who dared to come out in 2006. Gohil set up Lakshya, the first NGO in the country that created employment opportunities for gay men and worked to prevent the spread of HIV among the LGBTQ community. Even today Gohil strives to launch new concepts that generate awareness on the needs of the LGBTQ community. He was an ex-ambassador of Urvi Shah’s AGMB and has been encouraging other people to catalyze change.""Today when the Supreme Court of India is open to reviewing Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and is hearing petitions against criminalizing homosexuality, we need more young individuals working tirelessly to generate sensitivity to issues and needs of the LGBTQ community,"" Gohil said. ""I believe in mainstreaming the issues, and the support we are getting from young individuals like Kiran, Urvi and Abhishek, who do not belong to sexual minorities, is valuable. Such individuals can help in changing the mindset of the country.""Urvi Shah’s Arranged Gay Marriage Bureau also intends to focus on people with disabilities. “My close interactions with the LGBTQ community inspired me to extend the scope of matrimonial services to those who are grappling with physical and social challenges,” she said. “They need mutually rewarding companionships and are more afraid to come out.”“My NRI business partner, Benhur Samson from Chicago, who helps the LGBTQ community have children with surrogacy, assisted me in executing my idea of setting up AGMB, and we registered it in Secunderabad,” Shah said. “After completing my studies, I joined it as partner in February 2016. We started with a small number of subscribers.” Today, Shah solely handles the operations of the bureau which has 2,300 members.AGMB registers only those who are looking for a long-term monogamous relationship and are aware that they cannot get any certificates for their alliance. A dedicated team of 26 professionals scrutinizes registrations: first the subscriber has to take a detailed interview, fill up a long confidential questionnaire, share original documents establishing identity, and pay nominal commitment fees. “After matching biodata, we share details of the prospective match with the client and leave them to take it further,” says Shah."

KOLKATA: The dream project of 10 HIV-positive teenagers — that had hit many hurdles, from finding a house to acceptance by locals — finally started brewing from a Jodhpur Park address on Saturday afternoon. Café Positive, an entrepreneurship project by the 10 HIV-positive boys and girls, became operational at a 12 feet by 10 feet garage space at 524 Jodhpur Park in south Kolkata.The youths struggled managing the sudden rush on Day 1at the café that saw a huge acceptance from the Jodhpur Park neighbourhood as people started coming in and congratulating the young owners for their grit, determination and initiative while having café latte or iced tea.“I had read about the youths in the newspapers and empathised with them in their struggle. That they have finally found a place and that too in our neighbourhood feels great. Had I had a place to offer, I would have come forward and helped them long ago,” said Sharmistha Mitra, a resident of a Jodhpur Park apartment and one of the first few customers at the café.TOI had first reported on March 5 how six boys and four girls, who had undergone training in baking, sandwich-making and coffee and mocktail preparations, aspired to start their own coffee shop at some location in south Kolkata but were turned down by house owners.For youths like Sathi Biswas (name changed), Susanta Pal (name changed) and eight others who overcame the hurdles for almost a year, it was a dream come true moment. “We were turned down by so many house owners that at one point of time we had started wondering if we can at all open the café. But we are glad that the day has finally come,” said Biswas, serving Espresso and muffins to two new patrons.Helping them out was Kallol Ghosh, the brain behind the café and the founder of Anandaghar, where the teenagers were brought up. “It’s a day I have been dreaming for long. We had faced strange reasons from people for refusing space to these teenagers. While some said their family members were not ready, others said people in the neighbourhood wouldn’t allow them to run a business with HIV-positive patients. But finally the day has come when the ten have found the platform to break the myths surrounding the disease,” said Ghosh, who runs an NGO, Offer.Actor Parambrata Chatterjee , who was also present at the inauguration, said: “I was disheartened when I came to know that a city like Kolkata was hesitant to give an opportunity to them. Now that they have made it, I am really glad and hope the people turn up in large numbers to taste the delicacies prepared by the youths.”"

Essential list of medicines to be revised; medical devices and consumables may be included,2018-07-15,MUMBAI,"News,BUSINESS NEWS,India Business News","MUMBAI: In good news for patients, the government has decided to restructure the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), with the objective to make it more contemporary, and in line with their needs. For this purpose, the government will constitute a 'Standing National committee on Medicines' involving scientists, doctors and experts to ""review and revise"" the NLEM , and importantly which may include medical devices, disposables and consumables to the list, official sources told TOI.Only cardiac stents from medical devices were included in the NLEM in 2016, following a court order.The development assumes significance as the national list typically forms the basis of price caps extended on essential medicines by the drug prices regulator, as was done in the last revision, which was done in 2015.Also significantly, this time round a standing committee with a three-year term has been constituted, which will meet every six months to take stock and may incorporate changes in the essential list. With medical science and treatment evolving each day, there was a need of a committee which would have a longer tenure, the official added.As against this, NLEM was last revised in 2015 by a one-time committee formed by the health ministry, which expanded it to 384 drugs from the existing 348, after which ceiling prices were fixed by NPPA. At that time, only 348 drugs were in the NLEM-2011 which were subject to price controls.In the last exercise, though drugs for critical illnesses like cancer, HIV and diabetes were added, but many therapies were still missing.

Special teams leave for Chennai to nab accomplices of fake disaster expert,2018-07-16,COIMBATORE,"News,City News,Coimbatore News","COIMBATORE: The rural police have sent special teams to Chennai and Kanyakumari to nab the accomplices of fake disaster management trainer Arumugam, who helped him forge degrees and certificates. The police teams will also visit certain educational institutions in Tirunelveli to collect more information about Arumugam.Police had on Saturday interrogated Ashok of Pallapalayam in Erode , an accomplice of G Arumugam of Vandalur in Chennai, who claimed to be a trainer from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and conducted a disaster management drill at a private college in Coimbatore on Thursday, resulting in the death of a girl student.Ashok, a supplier of packaged drinking water, was quizzed at the Karunya Nagar police station. He told police that Arumugam used to pay him Rs 2,000 for assisting him during the drills.Preliminary inquiry revealed that Arumugam’s parents passed away when he was a school student. “After his relatives refused to support him, Arumugam and his younger brother Gandhiraj approached a textile shop owner in Tirunelveli looking for jobs.

He learnt disaster management lessons from there and started to conduct drills in educational institutions. He also told us that he worked as an accountant at Donisha Academy, run by a trust called Corra. He said that the trust helped him get the fake appointment order from the National Disaster Management Authority(NDMA),” the officer told TOI.After Arumugam said that he is in love with a nurse of a private hospital located on Avinashi Road, a police team interviewed her. “The woman told us that she had befriended him after attending a disaster management drill he conducted while she was a nursing student. But she said she was not in love with him.”A police team has left for Kanyakumari to meet a college professor after Arumugam claimed to have known her for a long time. Police are also trying to trace the whereabouts of his younger brother.“He revealed the names of some Chennai residents, who helped him forge the documents.

Drug-resistant TB: TN rolls out nine-month drug antibiotic regimen,2018-04-17,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News","CHENNAI: The state health department rolled out a new nine-month drug antibiotic regimen for drug-resistant TB instead of the old two-year course. The drugs that will be available free of cost in government hospitals will improve outcomes, reduce dropout rate and help Tamil Nadu move towards elimination before 2022, health minister C Vijaya Baskar said.The new regimen – also a cocktail of antibiotics including tablets and injectable – is approved by international agencies such as the World Health Organisation for approved their usage in extensively multi drug-resistant TB patients.Data show that at least 6% of TB patients in India have multi-drug resistance. In these people, bacteria that cause the infection can develop resistance to isoniasid and rifampicin -- the two most powerful anti-TB drugs. Hence, they gave a two-year-long course with six drugs including an injectable.However, surveys found that despite free diagnosis and treatment, patients either opt out, delay or dropout of treatment. “This can worsen their condition and make them further resistant. They can also spread the resistant strain in the community,” said Dr S Kumar, who is the state nodal officer for treatment of MDR TB. At least 2.9% of new TB patients and 7.78% of previously treated TB patients in Tamil Nadu have MDR TB, according to a report by the union health ministry.The new regimen introduced by the central government has a better outcome and low dropouts, doctors say. “Studies done by the ICMR show that from 46% cure rate in the previous regimen, the short course has up to 85%,” he said. The shorter course has seven drugs for 9-11 months regimen. It is given exclusively for patients with MDR-TB regardless of their HIV status.The National Institute of Research in Tuberculosis is now undertaking a trial to see if the injectable antibiotic can be dropped out of the regimen. “It is one of the four regimens we are testing as a part of a multi-centric trial in nine countries,” said Dr Narendran Gopalan, principal investigator of the trial at the Indian site. The trial, funded by the International Union for TB and Lung diseases, is likely go on till 2022, he said.The health minister flagged off a hospital on wheels with a digital x-ray that will screen people with symptoms of TB."

April 18 is celebrated as International Day for Monuments and Sites.The daylong exhibition was inaugurated by Ashish Shende, assistant professor at Morris College. The exhibits included Narnala fort in Akola, Chandrapur fort, SNAGPURhiv temple in Buldhana, Lal Khan tomb in Amravati and Tillot — A megalithic dolmen in Bhandara, besides others. It also had on the display the images showcasing heritage sites before and after the conservation work was taken up.The display that caught everyone’s attention was the documentation of an ancient temple at Deotak in Chandrapur district which had information about steps taken for conservation like condition mapping, assessment, drafting, restoration and others.Talking to TOI, assistant archaeologist Shilpa Jamgade said, “Conservation can be technical or preventive. We focus on prevention and make people aware about the significance of these sites so that their mindset changes when they visit such places. This helps avoid deterioration of sites or monuments as people keep a safe distance from them. We mainly target school and college students as they are a good medium to create awareness.”The ASI also launched a cleanliness fortnight and removed filth near the old high court building. There are plans to clean seven monuments, including three each in Nagpur and Chandrapur, and one in Lonar region, Jamgade said. This time, it will not just be a cleaning work and volunteers will strive to make these heritage sites and roads leading to them look cleaner and presentable.

"AADHAAR: Not sure if Aadhaar is best model to accord benefits, Supreme Court says",2018-04-19,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday said it was not sure whether bringing people ""face to face"" with authorities through Aadhaar was the best model as the state should reach them to accord the benefits of the welfare schemes.A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra , hearing a clutch of petitions challenging Aadhaar and its enabling 2016 law, was told by the counsel for the Unique Identification Authority of India UIDAI ) that the 12-digit national identifier brought the citizens face to face with the service providers for getting the benefits.""We are not sure if that is the best model. The individual should not be a supplicant. The state should go to him and give him benefits,"" the bench, also comprising Justices A K Sikri, A M Khanwilkar, D Y Chandrachud and Ashok Bhushan, said.The bench observed that the UIDAI says Aadhaar is a means for identification, but the ""only caveat to that is that there should be no exclusion"".Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for UIDAI and the Gujarat government, said the development was necessary to ensure that people are freed from poverty.Liberating people from poverty is at one end of the spectrum and the right to privacy is on the other, the bench observed.The UIDAI referred to social ills like manual scavenging and prostitution and said that despite laws, these evils were rampant in the society and the apex court should strike a balance while dealing with the competing fundamental rights of citizens.Referring to apex court judgements, the senior lawyer said it has been held that to save the freedom of speech and expression, the right to reputation of a citizen under Article 21 cannot be crucified.The apex court, besides being the protector of fundamental rights, is also a ""balancing wheel"" to ensure that competing fundamentals co-exist.Dwivedi then referred to a verdict by which a HIV+ve rape victim was denied the permission to abort the foetus after a doctors' panel gave the report that it could be fatal for the woman.""The court balanced the rights in the case where fundamental right to life was involved,"" he said, adding that in the present matter, the issue merely pertained to identification.""What is being done under section 7 of the Aadhaar Act covers human rights of a lot of people of our country. This court should act as a sentinel to ensure that right to privacy is balanced with all the other rights under Article 21 that Aadhaar covers,"" Dwivedi said.The counsel for Dwivedi would resume his submissions on April 24.Earlier, the bench had said that if biometric authentication is attached to every transaction entered into by a person, it would ""form a wealth of information"" necessitating the need for data protection."
Mystery cases of children testing HIV+ in Tamil Nadu rise,2018-04-23,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Civic Issues","CHENNAI: In 2017, 236 children below 18 years tested positive for HIV in the state, registering a near 25% decline in two years. While the number remains a concern for officials, what is worrying them even more is that they could not establish the source of the disease in 32 children, an increase of 10. This has led officials to believe that more children are engaging in highrisk sexual behavior or are victims of abuse.In 2015, of the 311 children who tested positive for HIV/ AIDS in the state, 289 contracted the infection from their HIV-infected mothers during pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding. Officials couldn’t establish the source of the infection in 22 children. Two years later, the number of parent-to-child transmission dipped along with the number of new cases detected among children, but the number of unaccounted cases touched 32, show data furnished by Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society in response to an RTI application by TOI.Officials and doctors say they suspect the mode of transmission of the infection among these children to be sexual as the increase is corroborated by an uptick in the number of children referred to government-run clinics for sexually transmitted infections. The number went up from 6,234 in 2015 to 8,871last year.Recognising the growing prevalence of STIs among children, TANSACS project director K Senthil Raj said he is in talks with the school education secretary to dedicate more space to sex education in the soon-to-be-introduced revamped textbooks.He said staff at the integrated counselling and testing centers (ICTC) for HIV usually maintain a record of children with the infection, including those who haven’t got it from infected mothers. “They usually don’t probe. But if they do find the reason during the counselling, they maintain it in their notebooks,” he said. Some of the children, he said, could have acquired it through blood transfusion or injectable drugs.Consultant psychiatrist Dr M Suresh Kumar, who has worked extensively with injection drug users, rules out this possibility. “Heroin and other synthetic injectable opioids were popular till the late 90s. We haven’t been seeing young heroin addicts in a while,” saidDr Kumar.Hisobservation is backed by official data: Of the 1.43 lakh people living withHIVin TNcovered under the central-sponsored prevention programme, 56 are users of injectibles. All are in their 40s and above. Dr Kumar saidthey are,however, seeing other kinds of addictions, including marijuana and alcohol,on the rise among youngsters. “It is known that high drug use can make you vulnerable to engaging in high-risksexualbehavior,” he noted.HIV specialist Dr S Sundar observed that the state should expand its HIV/AIDS prevention programme to youngsters who aren’t part of the traditional “high-risk” group. “All our programmes are targeted at the high-risk population like female sex workers, transgenders, men who have sex with men and truck drivers. But ask a counsellor at an ICTC who he or sheseesthe most–itisusually people who are not part of this group,” hesaid. “Children are engaging in sexual activity belowthelegal ageof consent. It is a fact. They could be in a situation where nobody will even ask for consent,” added Sundar.Whatever be the source, once diagnosed, these children are forced to battle the stigma associated with the infection or live in the fear that someone may find out they are positive, said P Manorama, former chairperson of Child Welfare Committee, Chennai, who runs an organisation that works with children withHIV. Shesaidshe receives at least one child trafficking victim a year who tests positivefor HIVlinkedto sexualexploitation. “Butthey remain mere names in the state’s medical records. Officials don’t investigate further,” saidManorama, adding that TANSACS should coordinate with other departments to tackle these cases."
Outpatient wards of Tirupur GH shifted to main campus,2018-04-24,Tirupur,"News,City News,Coimbatore News","Tirupur: Except three departments , outpatient wards of other departments in Tirupur government hospital have been shifted from old campus near Old Bus Terminus to main campus on Dharapuram Road.The shifting was necessitated to bring both the outpatient and inpatient wards under one roof.Moreover, the shifting process was speeded up to pave way for the construction of a new overbridge alongside the bus terminus. Over 1,700 sq m of land has been acquired from the hospital’s old campus for the overbridge project.Joint director of health services, Tirupur, S Soundararajan said, “Emergency treatment was not available in outpatient wards of the old campus. So, the state health department took a decision to shift the outpatient ward from the old campus to the main campus. The outpatient wards were functioning in the old campus since pre-independence.”“So far, we have shifted all the departments except three - ophthalmology, dental and antiretroviral therapy centre (HIV). We will shift those three departments in slow pace because of different reasons including the shifting should not affect treatments given to HIV positive patients and availability of operation theatre for eye surgeries. Moreover, a physician would be in duty at the old campus to attend outpatients, who were not aware about the shifting,” Soundararajan said.CPM district secretary S Muthukannan told TOI: “Senior citizens will face inconvenience to travel to the main campus after shifting the outpatient wards.”“As per information obtained under the RTI Act, 75,000 patients visit OP wards in a month, which means more than 2,500 patients in a day. Since the shifting would affect many people, a public interest litigation (PIL) was preferred before the Madras high court,” Muthukannan added.Soundararajan said, “The department was taking steps to shift the wards for the past two years. It has constructed a furnished building at the main campus, where the OP wards have started functioning now. The turnout of outpatients has been increasing day-by-day. Moreover, even if the government will bring the medical college, as sought, all wards should be functioning in the main campus.”"
"No dengue, malaria deaths in Telangana, shows report",2018-04-26,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Hyderabad News,Civic Issues","HYDERABAD: In 2017, Telangana could have reported at least 35-40 dengue deaths, most of them from Hyderabad. Yet, not one gets reflected in the data complied under the ministry of health and family welfare’s ‘National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme’. While it pegs the total dengue cases for the year at 3,061, it shows that the state reported no deaths during this period. Similarly, there is no mention of any death caused due to other infectious diseases such as malaria and chikungunya — a claim vehemently debated by health experts. They insist that the deaths, including an estimated 10 related to malaria, went unrecorded.Their reason: absence of a state-level registry or centralised monitoring system for diseases except cancer and HIV . According to experts, even the incidence of diseases is largely under-reported in the state, because of the same issue. As a result, the report gives an impression about Telangana faring better than other states in these diseases, even as the reality is far removed, they add.“While the state identified the need for a robust monitoring system for diseases, data collection has remained on the back seat so far,” said a senior health official, adding how most private hospitals fail to keep the state informed about cases related to infectious diseases. “The poor follow-up process (after a patient is treated and discharged) among hospitals also leads to under-reporting of possible deaths.”Raising a serious word of caution over this gap in monitoring, experts say that the government must intervene in the matter immediately as it could have long-term implications. “Such data is crucial for public policy, research and prevention of various communicable, infectious and noncommunicable diseases and should be made public each year,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari, president, Helping Hand Foundation, an NGO working in healthcare."
Meet Harishchandra Dhivar who wrote 200 poems while seated in BMC garbage trucks,2018-04-29,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: While many a poet would wax eloquent about how a river bank or a forest inspires him to write verse, Harishchandra Dhivar , a conservancy worker , says he has had the pleasure of penning poetry inside a garbage truck while seated atop a heap of junk. The 49-year-old, who had failed his Class X, recently won the first prize in a poetry-writing competition organized by a literature group in Shegaon, Buldhana.Dhivar has worked for the BMC for the past 25 years and most of his working days are spent inside dumping grounds or cleaning the city’s streets.While a majority of his fellow workers took to alcoholism to mask the difficulties of their job, he chose to write. Dhivar has written more than 200 poems and several verses in a truck on its way to a dumping ground. “Some of my poems have been published in more than 10 books. These books are compilations of works of several poets. I also have a solo book coming up in the next two months,” an excited Dhivar told TOI at his residence in a Mukund Nagar chawl at Chembur Dhivar said he has been inspired by the well-known poet Narayan Surve who is credited with giving the working class a voice in Marathi literature. The first poem that Dhivar wrote in year 2000 was titled ‘Ase kuthvar chalayche (How long can we go on like this)?’“The poem talked about the status of women in our families and their fight for equal rights,” said Dhivar.He first came to Mumbai from a small village in Purandar taluka near Pune city in the early 1990s after appearing for his Class X exam to earn a living. He had lost his father at the age of 13.“I first lived with my sister in her marital home; it was a 10 ft-by-10 ft shed in Chembur. The area was a marsh at that time,” said Dhivar and added that for the first few years he did odd jobs to survive and then began to sweep the streets for the BMC.“In the early 1990s, there was water scarcity in several parts of the state, especially Marathwada. Several families from Beed had migrated to Mumbai then and landed contractual jobs with the BMC,” he said.After working as a contractual staff for nearly five to seven years, the workers decided to form a union—Kachra Vahatuk Sangh— to fight for the rights of labourers and demanded that the BMC give them a permanent status. Dhivar, too, was actively involved in the protests and also wrote several catch lines and slogans for them.“He has contributed immensely to these protests. Through his writings and strike calls, these protests got a lot of traction,” said Milind Ranade, general secretary of the union.Ranande especially remembers one of Dhivar’s poems that he had written for the protest titled ‘Yaaro, humne panga le liye’ (Friends, we have picked our fight)’. Following the protests, Dhivar and several other labourers were made permanent by the BMC.Most of his poems talk about the deplorable condition of the labour class that works in the sanitation area and social issues like gender equality, condition of women, domestic violence, HIV, rape and even rampant alcoholism.“I have been writing for a long time, but now my son has taught me to post my writings on Facebook and WhatsApp, which has got me a lot of appreciation from known as well as unknown people,” said Dhivar."
Only 3% of rural women receive prenatal care,2018-03-09,PATNA,"News,City News,Patna News,Civic Issues","PATNA: Just 3% of pregnant women in state’s rural areas get prenatal care , the lowest among all other states in the country, according to the findings of National Family Health Survey (NHFS)-4 (2015-16) which were released by Unicef on the eve of International Women’s Day on Wednesday.Prenatal care, also known as antenatal care (ANC), is the care the pregnant women receive from healthcare professionals during pregnancy. The NHFS report stated that the percentage of pregnant women in Bihar , who had received the only first ANC out of the designated four ANCs, was 34%. The ANCs include interventions such as tetanus toxoid (TT) injection, measurement of blood pressure, iron folic acid tablets distribution, taking blood and urine sample, prevention from malaria by insecticide-treated bed-nets and counselling on pregnancy complications and HIV.“There is a need to track this dropout rate among women receiving ANC. A pregnant woman should take 300 more calories than normal calorie intake. However, there is no data in Bihar that can reveal how much calories are being taken by the pregnant women,” said Dr Syed Hubbe Ali, a Unicef health specialist.The state government has also failed to procure essential iron and folic acid supplements from past two years. These supplements were to be given to children under Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (WIFS) programme to meet the challenge of the high prevalence of anaemia.WIFS programme under Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) was launched in the country in 2014. “The weekly supplements of iron and folic acid is provided to children between 10 and 19 years of age, who are either in school or out of school,” Dr Ali said.Dr Y N Pathak, state programme officer of the nursing cell of State Health Society , however, said tender has already been floated and a firm shortlisted to supply supplements.As per NHFS-4, 58.7% of women population in the age group of 15 to 49 years in state’s urban areas and 60.5% of women in rural areas are suffering from anaemia against the national average of 51% and 54.3%, respectively.“Malnutrition is the result of a vicious intergenerational cycle. If a girl child is suffering from malnutrition, they get infected easily. This, in turn, adversely affects the iron absorption in their body. A child suffering from malnutrition grows into a weak and anaemic mother, which, in turn, leads to the birth of a weak child,” Dr Ali said."

"Medical fraternity: Facing bias, transgenders demand separate hospital",2018-03-13,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Hyderabad News","HYDERABAD: If not completely cut off from medical care, transgenders are often made to feel unwelcome in healthcare centres across the city. In fact, getting proper healthcare has turned out to be a nightmare for the transgender community, according to activists.Alleging that about 75-80% of transgenders are denied medical care in Hyderabad, Rachana Mudraboyina of the Telangana Hijra Transgender Samithi (THTS) said the government should urgently consider a separate hospital for transgenders.“They are not accepted in male wards nor are they allowed in female wards. The medical fraternity is still unsure about how to treat them,” Rachana said.Sharing the case of a transgender who was attacked in the city last year, Rachana said the injured person decided not to go to a hospital fearing discrimination and illtreatment.In another recent incident, she said, the injured was forced to leave the hospital without treatment as doctors could not decide whether to admit the patient into a male or female ward.Most members of the transgender community have stopped going to hospitals fearing the trauma they will have to go through, activists said.“It is very important that we make our hospitals discrimination-free and treat transgenders at par with other genders. The immense amount of stress that a transgender person has to deal with in the fear of being treated unfairly is enough to stop them from seeking any kind medical help,” said city-based rehabilitation psychologist Radhika Nallan Acharya.According to experts, the situation needs immediate government attention and support as many in the transgender community require urgent medical care for ailments like HIV and tuberculosis."

In March 2017, when she got pregnant, a private doctor informed her that she was HIV+. Subsequently, the pregnancy was terminated.After her in-laws realised that she was HIV+, they allegedly stopped her from cooking in the house, started starving her and harassed her mentally and physically while alleging that she transmitted the disease to her husband.Given the torture from her in-laws, she contacted her brother, who took her home in May 2017. While none of her in-laws came to take her back, her husband died of AIDS in January 2018. The woman was also verbally abused by her in-laws when she went to attend her husband's funeral.Feeling cheated and humiliated of being falsely accused of transmitting the disease to her husband, the woman lodged a complaint with the Kopargaon police on March 5, which was transferred to the Mumbai Naka police in Nashik city on Wednesday.Speaking to TOI, one of her relatives said that despite being closely related to the in-laws, the woman was cheated.

Manvendra Singh Gohil to create module on third gender issues,2018-03-16,AHMEDABAD ,"News,City News,Ahmedabad News","AHMEDABAD : Prince of Rajpipla and Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer (LGBTQ) activist, Manvendra Singh Gohil , is set to form an educational module on third gender issues and Section 377 IPC for law students at Karnavati University. The proposal for creating the module was put forth by the vice-chancellor of the varsity , Dr Deepak Shishoo, on Thursday, soon after Gohil addressed a lecture at the varsity.Talking to TOI, Gohil said, “The module will educate students about something that the education system avoids. Considering the fact that India reports the third-highest number of HIV positive cases in the world, lack of knowledge and sex education can be further detrimental to the spread of sexually transmitted infections.”Gohil added, “Issues around gender and sexuality often have taboos associated with them and bringing them to students on an academic forum will help broaden their outlook.”“Even as it was proposed on an open forum, I immediately agreed because social change can happen from an educational institute. If one institute takes the initiative, others will follow suit,” Gohil said.Highlighting the academic rationale behind the proposal, Dr Shishoo said, “The module will not merely talk about Section 377 of the IPC but rather include trivia on how the law came into force and the debate that followed after a Delhi High Court judgement as well as the Supreme Court judgement.”“The idea is to make it an exhaustive module including how the law evolved and its impact in addition to other issues,” said Dr Shishoo.Gohil mentioned his plans to set up a resource centre on his palace ground to facilitate medical care for mental, physical and sexual health of the LGBTQ communities in addition to skill development and training for the community."
Antiretroviral Therapy: Free viral load test for HIV at three ART centres from April 19,2018-03-17,PATNA,"News,City News,Patna News,Civic Issues","PATNA: Three antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres in Bihar will carry out viral load testing for HIV/AIDS from April 19. It is under the ‘Viral load testing for all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV)’ initiative launched by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on February 26 this year.The ART centres selected in Bihar are at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) Patna and Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur.Total 530 ART centres have been selected for free viral load testing of 12 lakh PLHIV on treatment in the country at least once a year.The central government has tied up with a private laboratory in Mumbai under public-private partnership (PPP) mode to provide viral load testing facility to patients across the country. A senior state health department official said samples would be collected from the three ART centres and flown to the Mumbai laboratory for test. “A hard copy of the report will be sent to the state,” he said.Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) targets and destroys CD4 T cells that strengthen immunity in a person. Patients with a CD4 count below 200 are susceptible to develop serious illnesses. Viral load testing essentially tells whether the ART treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of virus in a patient’s blood.“In more than 95% cases, the viral load becomes undetectable after six months of ART treatment. Earlier, the only test conducted to measure the effectiveness of treatment was to check the immune level (CD4 test) in a patient. Sometimes, the patient also becomes drug-resistant after treatment and thus the viral load increases. With viral load testing in government ART centres, it will be possible to detect the increase of the viruses in the blood of the patient after treatment,” a member of International AIDS Society, Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, said.There are only three private labs in Patna for collecting samples for viral load testing and they charge approximately Rs4000- 4500 for one test."

Govt not using patent law effectively: Pharma body,2018-03-20,"The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance , an association of 20 top Indian pharma companies that account for 80% of the country’s exports and 46% of the domestic market, has submitted a report to the government that says that public health safeguards in the patent law were not being used effectively.The IPA pointed out that an analysis of patent filings between 2007 and 2012 had shown that a third of the patentees got away with not disclosing whether a patent was being used or not and a third were defective or incomplete.In a report submitted to the Indian Patents Office and the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion , the IPA referred to an ongoing case in the Delhi high court seeking directions to the government to compel patentees and licensees to declare information on the working of their patent as required under the Patent Act.The IPA report pointed out that many subsections in the Act were introduced to safeguard public health, prevent abuse of patent rights and ensure that patents contributed to dissemination of technology.

Story of an ‘Undying Flame’,2018-03-25,CHANDIGARH,"News,City News,Chandigarh News","CHANDIGARH: What could have been a routine story for this former journalist, turned out to be an experience that seared her soul. Anshu Seth released her debut book, the Undying Flame – as an act of closure and tribute to a man who saw his son edging towards death for 10 years. It was one of those stories that transformed Anshu into a cynic and a woman of faith.Releasing her book at Chandigarh Press Club on Wednesday, she said, “This was a man’s fight for his son and against the system. Som Prakash’s son Gulshan had renal failure and was given HIV infected blood. He knew how it would end. He raged against those who casually doomed his son to death and got away with it,” she recalled.As the father of the dying boy was caught in a maze of red tape and stony hearts, Anshu felt his pain, heightened by the fact that she could not restore his son back to life and health. Mother of two herself, she found there was only one thing she could do. “I would listen to him whenever he wanted to talk. Be it 2am or 6am. Often, I would give him all the money I had in my purse, knowing how inadequate that was. Now, I have penned his story because there were things I wanted the world to know. This story deserved to be told. But I wish I could do more,” she said.Through the book, she wanted Som Prakash to know it was not in vain. “He was intensely lonely, very scared and devastated. Since he could not get good treatment for his son in his native place Karnal, he came to PGI . But even back then, it was difficult to get the doctors’ attention in PGI. So Ludhiana was his best bet. Relatives helped him initially but later turned away. He sold all his land and took loans which he wondered how to pay back,” she recalled.Driven by the need to make his struggle public, Anshu finished the book in three months, writing late into the night and greeting the dawn pounding away on her keyboard. Except for the father and son, Anshu has used fictitious names for the rest of the characters. “I do not have an organiaation supporting me in this story. So I had to play safe,” she smiled."
Kiran Bedi: Kiran Bedi stresses on need to reduce debt as expenses go up by 11.7%,2018-03-27,PUDUCHERRY,"News,City News,Puducherry News","PUDUCHERRY: The new industrial policy unveiled in 2016 by the Puducherry government has attracted projects with proposed investment of Rs 178 crore, said lt governor Kiran Bedi while delivering the customary address ahead of the budget session on Monday.Puducherry Industrial Promotion, Development and Investment Corporation (Pipdic) has approved 121 projects and allocated 183 acres of land, 17 industrial sheds and seven plots with the investment proposal of Rs 620 crore, which will generate employment for 2,440 people in the Union territory, she said.Bedi said the Union government, which selected Puducherry under the smart city proposal, has released Rs 98 crore in the present financial year. The Union government has also sanctioned Rs 66 crore under heritage circuit and Rs 41 crore under spiritual circuit through the flagship scheme, ‘Swadesh darshan’ in the present fiscal year.“This will help Puducherry and its outlying regions to preserve its heritage value and enhance the spiritual atmosphere apart from attracting tourists,” she said, adding that Puducherry witnessed a growth of 9.5% in tourist arrivals in the calendar year 2017 compared to the previous year.She said Puducherry stands first among the Union territories and second in all India level in infant mortality rate, which is 10 per 1,000 live births against the national-level ratio of 34 per 1,000 live births.“The key indicators attained by this Union territory under health sector are very commendable. 99.98% are institutional deliveries out of 41,480 deliveries. The number of severely malnourished under 5-year children is 0.02% in the UT and moderately malnourished children is 0.1%,” she said.Similarly, Puducherry stands first with a least HIV prevalence rate of 0.2%. “The HIV prevalence rate in the country is 2.69%. This Union territory ranked first in achieving zero prevalence in HIV as per the HIV sentinels surveillance done by Naco in 2017 for ante-natal women,” she said.Bedi sounded the warning bell pointing out that the anticipated expenditure during the current financial year would be Rs 2,334 crore, which is 11.67% higher than last year’s expenditure. “This Union territory is facing financial constraints due to servicing of past debt. Now there is an urgent need to reduce our debt burden and hon’ble members will certainly appreciate the need for austerity measures,” she said.The government declared Puducherry and Karaikal regions as drought-hit following deficit and uneven rainfall and inadequate receipt of Cauvery water. The government disbursed Rs 13 crore towards inputs subsidy to the affected farmers as per NDRF norms, she said.Bedi said the government has completely waived the farmers’ loans to the extent of Rs 19 crore, benefitting 4,908 farmers.Citing a report of the Union human resources development ministry which placed Puducherry in the fifth position in the country in higher education, she said the UT has emerged as a hub in the field."

"Hepatitis B, C cases rise by over 60% in Telangana",2018-03-27,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Hyderabad News,Civic Issues","HYDERABAD: Hepatitis B and C cases have been on a sharp rise in the state with medical experts pegging it to anywhere between 60-70% over the last two years.Apart from insufficient haemovigilance (surveillance procedures used to test blood during donation, surgeries etc), experts also cite lack of sterilization, especially during dental procedures and endoscopy, as reasons for this spike in count.“From four-five cases of Hepatitis B a month two years ago, I now treat about 20 a month. The number of Hepatitis C cases are also increasing phenomenally,” said Dr K S Somasekhar Rao , consultant gastroenterologist at a city-based hospital and founder, Save the Liver Foundation. He added: “During procedures like endoscopy and root canal, if instruments are not adequately sterilised, it can lead to the spread of the viruses.”According to a study by the foundation, the Hepatitis B load in Mahbubnagar and Gadwal , for instance, is a staggering 15% as against a normal 3.5% across the country.Elaborating on the issue of haemovigilance, doctors said that while many blood banks do not conduct the HBsAg test (meant to detect Hepatitis B), even those who do fail to detect the virus, at times. “In at least 10% of the cases, the HBsAg test does not pick up the Hepatitis B virus. As for Hepatitis C, a majority of the blood banks do not perform the Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) or the Anti HCV test,” added Dr Rao.Part of the reluctance to carry out these tests, experts say, is because of the additional cost involved in it. “The test can cost anywhere between Rs 500 and Rs 1500 (depending on the facility). It is also largely ignored largely due to the lack of awareness,” said Dr Vijay Kumar , founder, Blood Cross Society , adding how the two viruses are more dangerous than HIV."
"Help centres may need to be doubled, say experts",2018-03-15,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Hyderabad News","HYDERABAD: Though sufficient to handle the current load of HIV patients in the state, number of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) centres in Telangana might soon need to be doubled, say experts. Reason being the updated guidelines of National Aids Control Organization NACO ). Now, Telangana has an ART centre in almost all districts apart from at least two centres of excellence.But while till now, ART treatment was extended only to patients with a CD4 count (a snapshot of the functioning of a patient’s immune system) of less than 500, as per revised norms, patients with a count of less than 350 CD4 too will be offered ART treatment hereafter.“This will increase the count of patients, which is likely to increase the load on ART centres by at least 30-40% over the next couple of years. Though existing ART centres have been accommodating the increasing number of cases being reported, there is a need to upgrade their infrastructure drastically,” said Dr Naval Chandra , additional professor, department of general medicine, Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences.Latest data with state health department shows 12,058 new cases of HIV/AIDS were reported in the state in 2016-17. At present, there are 1.78 lakh people with AIDS in the state of which 1.69 lakh are adults and 8,519 are children.Of this, nearly 35% are undergoing ART treatment. The data also hints at a 11,000-12,000 year-on-year increase in count of HIV patients."

After volunteers shifted him to a centre run for such patients, he lay there shocked for days after realising his family, employers and relatives had all turned their backs on him.While Ismail is currently undergoing treatment, not-solucky Sarita died on the road unattended near the KPHB Metro station few weeks back. The 32-year old HIV patient was staying on the road with her four children after losing her husband to AIDS five months earlier.From earning Rs 11,000 per month between themselves and being able to provide shelter, food and schooling for their children, the family fell apart completely and started living on the streets. The children were later moved to an orphanage by an NGO. In yet another case a brother wasn’t allowed to keep his HIV infected sister with him in a rented flat. He was forced to leave his sister at the state run Gandhi Hospital for over a month last year.Experts say more awareness on the disease is the only solution to the stigma. Discrimination looms large despite claims of the state health department about the stigma being on the decline. Activists say it may have worsened going by number of of HIV/ AIDS patients being abandoned by family members, dumped at hospitals, shown the door at the workplace and turned out from residential societies in the city."
Cell phone-based tech to allow at-home blood testing,2018-03-27,NEW YORK,News,"NEW YORK: Scientists have developed a new cell phone-based blood testing technology that can provide immediate results in the comfort of one's home or a doctor's clinic.Researchers at the University of South Florida in the US created a mobile version of the "" Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay "" (ELISA), the gold standard technique used to detect the presence of an antibody or antigen.Instead of sending patients to a laboratory, new cell phone-based technology allows for the very same test to be conducted in the doctor's office, clinic or even in a remote area.""ELISA is an important technology for biochemical analysis of proteins and hormones and is critical for the diagnosis of many diseases, such as HIV and Lyme Disease,"" said Anna Pyayt, assistant professor at the University of South Florida.""But the machines required for the incubation and reading are expensive and bulky. The MELISA allows patients to undergo testing and obtain results at point-of-care,"" said Pyayt, corresponding author of the study published in the journal Biosensors and Bioelectronics.The Mobile Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (MELISA) device accurately measures progesterone levels, a key hormone that impacts female fertility and is indicative of some cancers. MELISA consists of a water bath heater that incubates samples at a target temperature and analyses them via images taken by mobile phone.It uses colour analysis to determine the RGB (red, green, blue) colour components of each sample.The blue colour component is used for further analysis due to its sensitivity to the changes in progesterone concentration.""It is designed to make biomedical testing simple and affordable. When low cost testing can be integrated with routine clinic visits, this would greatly improve the quality of healthcare and detect worrisome signs earlier,"" Pyayt said.The portable MELISA weighs just one pound, dramatically helping older patients suffering chronic conditions and those across the world."

Sex trade going online new challenge for KSACS,2018-04-10,THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,"News,City News,Thiruvananthapuram News,Civic Issues","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Sex trade going online in the state has become the biggest challenge for the Kerala State AIDS Control Society KSACS ) in its fight to properly deal with HIV positive cases as they are unable to track sex workers and provide them periodic check-ups and treatment. The society has sought the help of NGOs to track online sex workers and monitor their health.“Now, 60 NGOs in the state are working for KSACS to track those who are involved in the online flesh trade and register them with our anti-retroviral centres. It is a big challenge since it is not easy to track them,” said Dr R Ramesh , project director, KSACS.The mission of KSACS is target intervention and it has become difficult for us since the flesh trade is now happening through online.“For this, we have engaged several NGOs who are tracking them. There are people who have changed into online trade from public prostitution. From them we are collecting details of others,” said Dr Ramesh.But the challenge before the KSACS is the fact that most of the people involved in the online trade are not interested in getting registered and undergo regular check-ups. HIV-positive people working with certain NGOs are trying hard to persuade them to get registered.“From the roads, railway stations, bus stands and lodges, the modus operandi of flesh trade has changed. The new-age trade is thriving in major citys like Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Kannur and Kozhikode,” said the KSACS project directorHe further said: “In Malappuram and Kozhikode, we are getting reports of men-to-men online sex trade . The NGOs are concentrating in these areas too. But we are sceptical on how many can we track.”As per our mission, every year we should find 25% of new HIV patients. But this has become difficult now since screening confines to occasions like voluntary blood donation, pregnancy test and surgery procedures.The high-risk groups like women and men sex workers, migrant labourers, drug users and transgenders are being regularly monitored after they are registered with ARC centres, Dr Ramesh added.At present Kerala has 30,253 HIV positives and the HIV prevalence rate is 0.12% when the national prevalence rate is 0.26%."

Admissions under RTE to begin on April 20,2018-04-12,TIRUPUR,"News,City News,Coimbatore News","TIRUPUR: The admission under the Right to Education ( RTE ) Act would start in the private schools in the district on April 20. To maintain transparency in the admission process, the district administration emphaised a few additional guidelines issued by the state government to be followed by the schools.As many as 150 private schools, other than minority institutions, were functioning in the district. About 2,650 seats were available under the 25% mandatory quota under the Act this year. The candidates could apply for the seats between April 20 and May 18.The children from marginalised section, orphans, HIV-affected, transgender, differently-abled as well as children coming from modest backgrounds could apply for the seats.

Child sex abuse: More TN kids queue up in clinics to treat sexually transmitted infections,2018-04-19,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News","CHENNAI: Tucked away in obscure corners of government hospitals, clinics for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have coughed up data that could be crucial evidences of child rape. In 2017, doctors from various institutions referred nearly 900 children below 10 years to these centers after suspecting or confirming sexual abuse – double that of 2015.The number is higher in the 11-15 years age group: 2,248 children consulted doctors in these centres last year, up from 1,475 two years ago, show statistics furnished by Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) in response to an RTI application by TOI.Doctors say at least three in every 100 children in these age groups test positive for a sexually transmitted infection ( STI ). Test results of the rest either returned negative or the children were too scared to name the perpetrators or the source. Disclosed or not, all their details remain mere squiggles in government hospital records.Under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences ( POCSO ) Act, 2012, doctors have to report a medico-legal case in all incidents of child sexual abuse, failing which they could be sentenced to six months imprisonment and/or levied a fine under Section 21 of the Act.The extent of underreporting is evident when one compares the crime rate against children with the number of those who approach the state-run STI clinics. In 2016, 1,583 cases were registered under POCSO, including 1,169 of child rape. The same year, 8,871 children and adolescents consulted the designated clinics for STIs and reproductive tract infections (DSRC). Around 35% tested positive for at least one STI.In children, STIs can occur by sexual abuse, voluntary sexual contact or, in rare instances, blood transfusion and needle pricks. A pregnant woman who has syphilis -- spread through vaginal, anal and oral sex – can also pass on the infection through the placenta to an unborn child. Doctors however say due to availability of better antenatal care, cases of congenital syphilis have declined consistently over the past two decades.The state government has 157 DSRCs. TOI spoke to doctors in at least seven such centers. All of them had seen at least one child below 15 years who tested positive for an STI in the last two months. None of them reported to the police. “They come through referrals,” said a faculty from the department of dermatology and venerology, Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital, Salem. “We presume doctors who are the first point of contact report if they suspect sexual abuse,” he said. Asked if he shared the STI/RTI test results with the referee physician, he replied in the affirmative: “If they ask for it.”Last year, the doctor saw a 7-year-old boy who had initially approached the hospital with a high temperature. The child was referred to him when the attending physician noticed lesions in his genital area. He tested positive for secondary syphilis. “He was clearly a victim,” said the doctor. The child, accompanied by his grandmother, was asked to return for follow-ups.“He was always lively. But the minute we tried to extract information, he would grow sullen,” said the doctor. And, one day, three months later, the boy finally spoke -- about how he was scared to sleep. Every time he slept, his grandmother’s partner would rouse him to rape him. When counsellors at the center advised his grandmother to lodge a police complaint, she immediately agreed. That was the last time they saw the child.The designated STI clinic in the hospital in the last four years confirmed abuse to be the cause of STIs in at least six children – four girls and two boys -- all below 10 years.In a similar incident, a 6-year-old boy from Villupuram, who had genital warts, one of the most common symptoms of STIs, vanished from the health department’s radar when he revealed to a counsellor in the government general hospital here that he had been sodomised by a senior in the government residential school he stayed in. Doctors healed the child physically, but when they asked his parents, both migrant labourers, to register a police complaint, they refused.Most of the children, doctors say, come with viral STIs like herpes genitalis, secondary syphilis and warts.Doctors say symptoms of STIs usually don't surface immediately after abuse. The patients have to be followed up for up to six months. However, this is rarely done for child rape survivors. Sherin Bosko, co-founder of Nakshata, an organisation that works for child rape victims, said after the initial medical examination and screening for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, doctors don’t ask these children to return for follow-ups. ""This should be taken seriously. These children are at high risk of contracting infections as the perpetrator is bound to have had multiple relations,"" she said.The increase in children attending these clinics has surprised health officials too. National AIDS Control Organisation requires DSRCs to maintain data of the number of overall attendees who are above 18 years old and below. “We don’t stress too much on finding the transmission mode, to ensure patient privacy. We hadn’t really thought of these records being an indicator of child abuse until now,” said Dr K Senthil Raj, project director, TANSACS.Not all those referred to these clinics were forced into having sex. The DSRC at the government general hospital in Chennai attended to 968 children below 18 years in 2017, 46% of them in the 11-15 years age group.Dr S Kalaivani, head of the department of venereology, said abuse accounted for less than 1% of the children the clinic received. “What we see now is a lot of sexual adventurism. There is an increase in boys, especially those staying in hostels, engaging in unsafe homosexual behavior,” she said, stressing on the need for schools to boost sex education. “And we need to start early. The sexually active age of children now starts at 12,” she said.Children between 16 and 18 years accounted for 64% of all paediatric cases referred to these clinics. India's age of consent for sex is 18 under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013."
'Novel implant to protect women from HIV infection',2018-04-16,TORONTO,News,"TORONTO: Scientists have developed a vaginal implant that can protect women from HIV infection by decreasing the number of cells that the virus can target in their genital tract.Unlike conventional methods of HIV prevention, such as condoms or anti-HIV drugs, the implant takes advantage of some people's natural immunity to the virus, according to researchers at the University of Waterloo in Canada The implant, described in the Journal of Controlled Release, is composed of a hollow tube and two pliable arms to hold it in place.It contains hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which is disseminated slowly through the porous material of the tube and absorbed by the walls of the vaginal tract.""We know that some drugs taken orally never make it to the vaginal tract, so this implant could provide a more reliable way to encourage T cells not to respond to infection and therefore more reliably and cheaply prevent transmission,"" said Emmanuel Ho, a professor at the University of Waterloo.""What we do not know yet is if this can be a stand-alone option for preventing HIV transmission or if it might be best used in conjunction with other prevention strategies,"" said Ho.HIV infects the body by corrupting T cells that are mobilised by the immune system when the virus enters a person's body.When the T cells stay resting and do not attempt to fight the virus they are not infected and the HIV virus is not transmitted between people. When the T cells stay resting, it is referred to as being immune quiescent.The implants were tested in an animal model and the team observed a significant reduction in T cell activation, meaning that the vaginal tract was demonstrating an immune quiescent state.The new implant was inspired by previous research involving sex workers in Kenya In Kenya, Ho and research partner Keith Fowke of the University of Manitoba , observed that many of these women who had sex with HIV positive clients but did not contract the virus.They later found the women possessed T cells that were naturally immune quiescent.""Observing this, we asked ourselves if it was possible to pharmacologically induce immune quiescence with medication that was better assured of reaching the point of infection,"" said Ho.""By delivering the medication exactly where it is needed, we hoped to increase the chances of inducing immune quiescence,"" he said."

"In 3 years, blood donations decline in Delhi",2018-04-04,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Delhi News","NEW DELHI: Blood donated voluntarily in Delhi went down from 55% of total collection to 45% between 2014 and 2017. This was determined by CAG in an audit of 68 blood banks in the capital for the period up to March 2017. Most blood banks, the audit showed, rely on replacement blood — blood given by a patient’s relative or friend in lieu of blood used from the hospital stock — which carries a relatively higher risk of infection.Lok Nayak Hospital’s blood bank, for example, collected 56,245 units of blood in 2014-17. Of this, only 6% came from voluntary donors against the target of 90% set by the National Aids Control Organisation. The hospital told CAG last June that after the scrapping of the blood bank van a year and a half ago, blood donation camps could not be organised.Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, which managed 55% collection through voluntary donors, claimed the shortfall was due to lack of education and awareness and religious or health issues among the public. Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital, which recorded the highest of 72%, said it couldn’t meet the target of 90% due to shortage of manpower, equipment, counsellors and social workers.The audit report, however, pointed out that irrespective of the blood collected, none of the blood banks run by the state government or municipal corporations had run the Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAT) capable of detecting anomalies such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C in the ""least window period"". They relied instead on Elisa III test, which cannot detect infections transmitted in the immediate past, say a week or a month before donation. “Patients often arrange for professional donors. Such donors tend to conceal medical history, and if the screening system isn’t foolproof, infections can be transmitted,” said a doctor, who asserted NAT is a must.CAG reported that Delhi government decided in November 2009 to introduce NAT screening, initially by outsourcing tests to four major blood banks and attaching the smaller blood banks to this quartet, but the plan was not adequately followed up. “None of blood banks under Delhi government and MCD hospitals have NAT screening facility as of March 2017 whereas five out of nine blood banks under government of India and 17 out of 39 private blood banks were using NAT for screening blood,” the CAG report said.In 2014-17, the five blood banks at Lok Nayak, GTB, DDU, Sanjay Gandhi Memorial and Swami Dayanand hospitals prepared 4.47 lakh units of blood and its components of which 15% was discarded for reasons from expiry of shelf life to lack of storage facility and clotting. The audit observed that the hospitals did not establish quantitative norms for holding the blood and blood components allowing the transfer of excess blood and components to other blood banks to minimise wastage.All blood banks in Delhi enrolled for the blood locator app launched by the National Blood Transfusion Council in June 2015, but the CAG audit showed that 32 had not updated any information, thus defeating the purpose of providing real-time information to the end user. Doctors say that many patients die due to lack of timely blood transfusion and the government needed to standardise the system to ensure such discrepancies do not hamper the supply of the life-saving product."
HIV people with positive attitude,2018-04-04,By,"News,City News,Chandigarh News","By: Anindita AcharyaCHANDIGARH: At the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre of the PGIMER (Post Graduate Institute Of Medical Education and Research) for HIVpositive people , you might notice a woman in her midforties, sitting in a corner, wearing a big smile, engaging in polite conservation with the visitors, scribbling down their profile. She is Meena Vij, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2004.She was in her second pregnancy in 1994 when she learnt she was HIV +ve. She aborted the child and confronted her husband, who ran a hotel. “After initial hesitance, he accepted his relationships with multiple partners,” said Meena, whose son is 27 now, and HIV negative.There was no ‘happily ever after’ in Meena’s life with her husband, but today she helps the people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Chandigarh find love. She has married off eight of them. Her face lights up at announcing that barring one, the rest of the couples are proud parents of HIV-negative children. “Of the myths about the disease, one is that the babies born to a mother with HIV also test positive,” Meena said. “People are unaware that if the mother and her baby receive proper medication during pregnancy and after birth, the chances of it are very less.”Meena is a member of the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV/AIDS, or CNP+ for short. She is also a peer counsellor of Vihaan, a CNP+ programme. Network’s president Pooja Thakur was shunned by her in-laws when she tested positive along with her two sons a decade ago. Her eldest son, however, is HIV negative. Her husband died of AIDS. Pooja dared to go public about her HIV status in order to work for HIV awareness and counselling.Her positive attitude towards life rubbed on to several women and gave them the courage to live. One of them is today a member of Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (SACS), CNP+, and Vihaan. She joined the network in 2007 after losing her husband to AIDS. She could move to Chandigarh with her four children because of a supportive brother.Created in November 2005, CNP+ meets on the 25th of every month, for tasks such as introducing new members, following up on the missed cases, and linking the members with ART centres. Today, the network has 1,000-plus registered members, who pay an annual subscription of Rs 100.CNP+ and Vihaan participate in many programmes of the state society. “We tell the PLHIV to visit the 12 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) in Chandigarh for free testing. We ask people to practice safe sex,” said Rahul, HIV+ve for more than 10 years.Meena said: “More important than fighting the disease is to fight the social stigma that keeps people from sharing their HIV status with family and taking treatment. We share our life stories with these people to boost their morale. We are living examples that with proper medication and diet, one can live with this virus for years,” said Meena, HIV +ve for 24 years.The PLHIVs live as outcasts. Family and friends discriminate against them, while even doctors judge them. Pooja asked for countrywide order for the doctors and clerks to write “universal precaution” instead of “HIV positive” on their hospital cards, “so that the chemists don’t look at us differently when they see the stamp”.“If our identity is revealed, our children won’t get admission in schools,” said a member of the network, seeking government support for a home for HIV-positive children and a higher monthly pension for widows and children from the present Rs 1,000 and Rs 700, respectively. Ask Pooja about the free bus pass in Chandigarh for PLHIVs and she has a hearty laugh. “For seven years, no progress,” she said."
Govt’s policy to get TB cases notified draws flak from doctors,2018-04-05,PUNE,"News,City News,Pune News,Civic Issues","PUNE: The government’s carrot and stick policy to get TB cases notified has failed to cut ice with the doctors and chemists’ associations, who have raised the issue of violation of a patient’s privacy in the exercise.Under the government’s policy, private medical practitioners and chemists will get an incentive of Rs 500 for notifying a TB patient to the government. They may, however, land in jail if they fail to do so.“On one hand, law expects doctors to take consent for HIV testing and on the other, the government wants us to breach the confidentiality clause by notifying TB patients. Is it not contradictory?” asked senior orthopaedic surgeon Nitin Bhagli.He said there are many questions that are yet to be answered. “Many times, patients move from one doctor to another for various reasons. In such cases, who should notify? If all the doctors treating the same patient report, will it not lead to duplication? Many HIV-infected patients also have TB and they don’t want their diagnosis to be known. So, what should be done in such cases?” Bhagli asked.“Threatening doctors of imprisonment is the latest trend of the government. Why don't they arrest people spitting or urinating on roads since that is the biggest source of communicable diseases?” Bhagli said.Even chemists’ associations have raised the breach of privacy issue, among many problems faced by them in notifying TB patients. “It will be unjust to penalize a chemist for not notifying TB patients. Some chemists have computerized data. So, it is easy for them to collate and compile data of TB drugs dispensed under schedule H1. However, many chemists keep manual data, making the reporting of the TB data difficult. Besides, it involves breach of confidentiality and many patients are averse to divulging personal details to chemists,” Jagannath Shinde , president of All Indian Organisation of Chemists and Druggists, said.Health activist and medical expert Abhijit More of Jan Arogya Abhiyan said breach of confidentiality in such cases is a lame excuse.“It is not correct to hide behind patient’s right to confidentiality because this right is not absolute in case of notified communicable diseases with grave public health implications,” More said.Eye surgeon Sanjay Patil, vice-president of IMA, Pune branch, stressed on sensitizing doctors and chemists about notifying TB cases. “There is a need of a forum to discuss and to solve issues regarding this notification by involving all the stakeholders,” Patil said."

Patients are now forced to go to private pathology centres outside the hospital.Talking in this regard, chief medical superintendent at the hospital, Dr Kalyani Mishra said, “The contract has ended with the private pathology company on March 31 and the process to renew the contract is on. The service is expected to resume now within three days.”Poor patients, who till now didn’t have to pay for Pregnancy tests or tests for diseases like thyroid, jaundice, HIV, and pregnancy tests at the District Women Hospital, now have to shell out huge amounts of money for them, said an official source. Thyroid tests, for instance, cost Rs 300 to Rs 500 for outside the hospital.The hospital conducted around 191 tests. “Around 80 tests used to be conducted at the pathology centre on a daily basis. Since our contract with the pathology centre ended, we have been asking patients to go to SN Medical College Hospital or District Hospital,” said a staff at the hospital, who did not want to be identified.Rani Singh, a pregnant woman who had come to the hospital with her husband from Sadar Bhatti area for a thyroid test, said, “I was unaware that they no longer conduct tests here. Now I have to visit a private pathology centre as the doctor has asked for the test soon.”“I asked the hospital staff about when the service will resume but didn’t get an answer. There must be proper notice in this matter,” she added.Another patient, Meera Rathore from Madia Katra, said, “We used have tests done here for free. It is difficult for us to pay huge sums to private pathologies for the tests. Officials must continue the service for poor people like us.”"
"HIV infection: 8% of TB patients in Karnataka are HIV positive, third highest in India",2018-04-06,BENGALURU,"News,City News,Bengaluru News,Civic Issues","BENGALURU: The prevalence of HIV positivity among TB patients in Karnataka is the third highest in the country. According to the India Tuberculosis 2018 report released recently, 8% of the TB patients suffer from HIV infection and are aware of the condition.“HIV infection increases the risk of progression of latent TB infection to active TB disease , increasing the risk of death if not treated timely,” it adds.The highest prevalence of HIV among TB patients has been recorded by Nagaland (14%), followed by Andhra Pradesh (10%). One of the reasons why Karnataka is in the third position is emphasis given to the testing of HIV status of TB patients, say doctors with the state health and family welfare department.When it comes to total TB patients notified in the country, Karnataka is in the 10th position (81,187). Uttar Pradesh tops the list with 3,11,041 cases. When the prevalence of HIV among TB patients is considered, Uttar Pradesh reports only 1%, indicating poor testing.Bagalkot tops listBagalkot district tops the list of HIV prevalence among TB patients in Karnataka at 30%. It is followed by Belagavi (15%), indicating that TB care needs to be more focused on north Karnataka. Dharwad, Raichur and Udupi have 11% TB patients suffering from HIV.Dr Ramachandra Bairy, joint director, tuberculosis control programme, health and family welfare department, said early detection helps in controlling the infection. “In Karnataka, all HIV positive persons are tested for TB during their regular monthly antiretroviral therapy (ART) sessions. Likewise, all TB patients are tested for HIV infection,” he said.If people living with HIV have cough that persist for more than two weeks and develop any gland in neck, they are immediately referred for TB testing, he added."
"How 10,000 devadasis live their lives in Karnataka",2018-04-09,BENGALURU,"News,City News,Bengaluru News","BENGALURU: Devadasi (Deva: God, dasi: female servant): Who is she? Is she the devout and pious caretaker of the goddess of the temple to whom she was dedicated to? Is she a beautiful dancer, singer, a well-bred companion? Or, is she the beautiful dancer of Bollywood film depiction, who falls in love with her dance master and suffers the wrath of the jealous king? She may have been some or all of these at different points of life but what she most certainly was, from the beginning, was being a subject of exploitation.It was around 2008 that I started examining gender issues in India, and that is how I came across documents on the realities of the Devadasi tradition. Contrary to previous knowledge, I made the shocking discovery that a devadasi is not even allowed to enter a temple, for she is of a low caste! After reading many variations of the myth and the origin of the Devadasi tradition, I had no doubt about the purpose of the myth. It was to use religion to ensure a supply of low-caste pubescent girls for the enjoyment of men.The myth behind the creation of this tradition would chill an adult. Rishi Jamadagni, husband of Renuka, orders the beheading of his faithful wife for a momentary lapse into sensual thinking. From this myth of momentary infraction, generations of women and their daughters have been turned into sex slaves in the name of religion.Traditionally, a devadasi mother is supposed to sacrifice at least one of her daughters to this practice or suffer the wrath of the deity. The most horrifying fact is that this practice continues in the 21st century. A recent census report of the Karnataka State Women Development Corporation shows that the state still has nearly 9,733 devadasis. The villages around Hospet, according to reports, have nearly 2000 devadasis. Every village that we visited had at least 20 to 30 devadasis , both young and old, waiting to speak to us, ignoring the hot sun!Why or how such a practice continues to prevail in any part of Karnataka, when it has stopped in most parts of the country, leaves a big question mark. Some think that such reports are untrue, but the reason the practice persists is simple. Between 2007 and 2011, news of this practice reached international communities. William Dalrymple’s article, ‘Serving the Goddess’ (New Yorker’s August 04, 2008 issue) created a storm in the US. The BBC and VICE sent journalists to investigate and make documentaries on the subject. Beeban Kidron’s Sex, Deaths and the Gods, and Harris’s Prostitutes of God, released one after the other, added to the outcry. But very little help reached the interior region of north Karnataka . Hence the persistence of the tradition in that region.The existing practice spans Bellary, Raichur, Gadag, Gulbarga, Haveri and Dharwad – the entire northern interior of Karnataka. Most of these areas are drought-prone, villages are remote, economic opportunities and literacy levels are low. Most older devadasis don’t know any other way of life. Absence of exposure, old beliefs and superstitions have left them frozen in the past — systemic rape and denial of basic rights to decide does not register to them as anything out of the norm. When asked most of them said, “Yes, if I had a daughter I would make her a devadasi,” or “If I marry her off who will look after me in my old age?”Devadasis can’t marry because they are married to a goddess. By the time they reach 40-45 years, men don’t come to them anymore. Their bodies are broken from malnutrition, hard labour, and even HIV infection. Most feel compelled to make their young daughter a devadasi for food and a roof over their heads. No one has come forward to develop any meaningful programmes in these villages. We met a 30-year-old devadasi in the privacy of her home to protect her identity. At the end of our conversation, she said to me, “Everyone comes to take our photographs, no one ever comes back to help us.” We met two young devadasis in their twenties – their parents dedicated them to the goddess because they were born with disabilities. The younger devadasis understand they have been robbed of a childhood, a normal life and fundamental rights over their own body. But most are unskilled labourers and are forced to resort to whatever work they can find to feed their children. Men who violate them, support them mostly when they are young, or when they are not pregnant.The devadasi women we met in these villages faced several challenges. Many have contracted HIV for not having the means to protect themselves. Most got pregnant soon after they were raped by men who bought them for the first night. In India, their children are considered illegitimate for they were born out of wedlock. The young devadasi mother struggles to support her children on her own – thus reinforcing her dependency on prostitution, or seasonal hard labour, deepening the problem of inter-generational poverty in these communities.NGO Vimukthi is probably one of the very few organizations, or the sole agency in Hospet, looking after underprivileged women and children with HIV. More recently they have committed themselves to working with devadasi communities. Being a relatively small organization, Vimukthi, does not have the necessary staff or substantial outside funding to meet the challenge. Until now they depended on funding from the state government to pay the staff, but recently they have even lost that. One wonders how, or if, these downtrodden devadasi mothers will ever get assistance to protect themselves from exploitation and educate their daughters to break the cycle!Between 2008 and 2012, large foundations such as the Bill & Melinda Gates and Clinton Foundations came forward to fund empowerment projects to eradicate the devadasi tradition in Andhra, Telangana and Karnataka. We have witnessed how these programs empowered and eradicated the tradition in Belagavi . It is time for major Indian corporations, philanthropists, UNICEF and large non-profits to take action.We are only talking about empowering 9,733 devadasis—not 90,000! In the past, MYRADA (Mysore Resettlement and Development Agency) took a leadership role in eradicating and empowering devadasis in Belagavi and other parts of Karnataka. Perhaps they can assist Vimukthi and advance eradication of this practice from Karnataka entirely. The devadasi system enforces child prostitution in the name of religion. This is not a matter of religion or tradition—this is a human rights issue.— Author Indrani Nayar-Gall is an interdisciplinary artist-activist, a former academic and the founder of Yes She Rises, a newly-formed volunteer organization engaged in empowering devadasi women and girls in Karnataka."
Immunisation key to reduce child mortality: IAP Pune branch,2018-04-30,Pune,"News,City News,Pune News","Pune: Experts associated with the Indian Academy of Paediatrics’ (IAP) city chapter have extended full support to the government’s immunisation efforts to save lives of children below five from vaccine-preventable diseases.The country’s aim is to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by reducing neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births by 2030. World Immunusation Week is observed between April 24 and April 30.“Childhood vaccines are one of the great triumphs of modern medicine. Over the last century, vaccines have been absolutely fundamental in overcoming the hurdle of many infectious diseases,” said paediatrician and IAP-Pune president Sanjay Lalwani.On December 25, 2014, the Centre launched Mission Indradhanush to immunise kids against seven vaccine-preventable diseases. It aims to cover all children by 2020 who are either not vaccinated or are partially vaccinated against seven vaccine preventable diseases in the initial stage.The seven vaccine preventable diseases are diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, tuberculosis, measles and hepatitis B. In addition, vaccines for Japanese Encephalitis (JE) and Haemophilus influenza type B are also being provided in select states under the Centre’s Universal Immunisation Programme.In 2016, three new additions have been made — Rubella, injectable polio vaccine (Bivalent) and rotavirus. In 2017, pneumonia was added to the mission by incorporating pneumococcal conjugate vaccine under the Universal Immunisation Programme.“The latest addition of pneumococcal vaccine is owing to the rise of pneumonia as a threat to child health. As per World Health Organisation data, pneumonia accounts for 16% of all deaths of children under five years old. Pneumonia alone kills more children under five years of age than measles, malaria and HIV combined. It has overtaken all other infections, including diarrhoea, to become the leading cause of under-five mortality in India accounting for 13% of all deaths,” Lalwani said.The latest national level survey conducted in 2015-16 revealed that the proportion of fully immunised children across the country is only 62.0%. “We still have a great challenge of reaching to each child without compromising with the quality of services. The IAP-Pune will carry out all sorts of awareness and sensitisation programmes to improve the vaccination coverage,” Lalwani said."
Blood simple: It boils down to window period,2018-04-30,THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,"News,City News,Thiruvananthapuram News,Civic Issues","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Window period still seems to be the elusive part while screening the blood collected at government hospitals to determine HIV cases. None of the hospitals in Kerala have a foolproof mechanism to detect HIV positive status.This assumes significance after a nine-year-old girl from Alappuzha , who allegedly tested HIV positive after undergoing a blood transfusion at Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) in Thiruvananthapuram, died in April. Recently, the parents of another 14-year-old child from Idukki alleged that their child died in March after allegedly contracting HIV during a blood transfusion at RCC.“In medical science, it is a fact that we do not have a foolproof mechanism in India. The latest technology – which reduces the window period is Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) that is not available in state government hospitals. We have only fourth generation ELISA tests which is now available only at RCC and Sree Chitra Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology,” said director of Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS) Dr R Ramesh.Even National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) does not have a complete formula to cover the window period and has implemented only tests that can reduce the window period risks. NAAT assures that the wind period can be reduced to 7 to 11 days. The fourth generation ELISA test assures only a window period of 2-4 weeks.“Here is our problem. Unless we promote safer voluntary blood donation and people prefer blood donation from their relatives, we will be at risk. KSACS is creating more awareness to promote voluntary blood donation. We are going to meet all CEOs and other department heads to promote voluntary blood donation in their organizations,” he said.Health minister K K Shailaja , who is worried over the alleged recent controversies, has decided to implement more stringer screening mechanisms at government hospitals. “Government hospitals see a huge demand for blood and a large volume of blood donations happen here. We need more stringent measures to screen donors,” she said.The volume of blood collected in a hospital like RCC is unimaginable. “RCC is perhaps the only hospital in Kerala where many blood transfusions occur and it has one of the biggest blood storage facilities. We collect blood from people and blood components are separated after a series of tests,” said Dr CV Prashanth, RCC, palliative medicine.Blood transfusions always carry certain risks, but HIV transmission during the process can be prevented. This can be achieved by setting up and maintaining a safe blood transfusion system and using blood appropriately. Ensure that the blood is screened for transfusion transmitted infections (TTI) such as HIV, hepatitis, malaria or presence of rare antibodies. The chance of HIV transmission through HIV-infected blood transfusion is 100%.“The only way to promote safe blood donation is voluntary blood donation and receiving blood from repeated donors. Regular donors are safer since their blood will be checked and screened periodically. During emergency, most people prefer blood from strangers, which carries a risk,” said Dr Prashanth.So, what is the solution? “Introduce NAAT facility in major hospitals like RCC and Sree Chitra. But adopting this technology is costly and the test for a unit of blood will be Rs 1,000,” said Dr Ramesh.KSACS, which closely monitors blood banks in state, has detected HIV positive cases in received blood. “In 2017, we received 3,72,000 units of blood of which 2,45,000 units were received at government blood banks. We encountered 260 HIV positive cases following the screening tests. These were discarded and donors were brought to our centre for treatment,” said Dr Ramesh.” KSACS is now promoting counsellors at blood banks to screen donors and find whether they belong to any kind of high-risk categories."
Centralized testing lab remains a dream,2018-04-30,KOCHI,"News,City News,Kochi News,Civic Issues","KOCHI: The proposal to introduce a centralized blood testing lab with nucleic acid test facilities (NAT) for Kerala is yet to see the light of the day. In 2014, the regional blood transfusion centre (RBTC), attached to district hospital in Aluva, had submitted a proposal to Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS) to set up one such facility at the blood bank. Indian Medical Association, Cochin had submitted a similar proposal to the government last year.RBTC officials said the central lab would not result in financial difficulties to the government. “If KSACS is ready approve the proposal, we can arrange facilities with resources at hand. What we need is the support for consumables,” said Dr N Vijayakumar, medical officerin-charge, RBTC, Aluva.“We have a blood transportation van and funds to purchase additional vehicles for transport of blood components at optimum temperature. We have a well-equipped government-recognized training centre for blood bank officers and technicians, one-of-its-kind in Kerala. It is the only NABH accredited blood bank here. No additional construction or personnel is required to start the centralized lab,” he said.“The logistics of collection, transport and submission of results can be assigned to the company that supplies the reagents and consumables. Karnataka and Odisha governments have entered into such agreements with suppliers,” he said.As of now, only IMA blood bank in Kochi and Thrissur Jubilee Medical College have introduced NAT. “In 2012, we introduced NAT. So far, we could prove 16 HIV negative cases detected under ELISA at other hospitals as positive with NAT. Given the fact that at least four blood components would be separated and given to different patients, we can say that 64 lives could be saved,” said ex-president of IMA, Cochin Dr Abraham Varghese , adding that centralized labs in Kozhikode, Kochi and the capital would solve transportation issues.But, KSACS added that NAT is not financially viable. “In Kerala, four lakh units of blood is required every year and NAT cost for a unit is Rs 1,000. We will have to shell out a huge amount for the purpose. It will be feasible to private hospitals that charge up to Rs 1,500 for testing. Even, NAT is not foolproof as there is a window period of up to 10 days. We plan to upgrade testing standards of each blood bank and promote safe and voluntary donation,” said Dr R Ramesh, project director, KSACS.Dr Varghese said that the cost won’t be so high as tests will be done after pooling samples. “We suggest pool testing as a group of samples would be pooled and tested. If the test result is positive only, we will go for individual sample test,” he said."

So, there is no interference is called for on a PIL by Brijesh Dubey, president of Global Alliance for Human Rights which has been working for the welfare of HIV+ patients.The Union Information and Broadcasting Ministry had issued a notification in which condom advertisement could be aired only from 10 pm to 6 am as some advertisements are “unhealthy and indecent for children.” However, an office memorandum issued by the ministry following a furroe clarified that regulation in the air timing of condoms is only for sexually explicit advertisements objectifying women.The central government in its order had clarified that advertisement on safe sex may be continued to be promoted without sexually objectifying women and or without carrying sexually explicit content.The petition had said ""there are various benefits of condoms apart from family planning. Condoms can prevent many sexually transmitting diseases like spread of HIV and AIDS. While efforts are made to popularize usage of condoms as the best means of dual protection the advisory comes as a dampener, it said."

Health minister flays attempts to malign RCC,2018-05-04,Thiruvananthapuram,"News,City News,Thiruvananthapuram News","Thiruvananthapuram: Health minister K K Shailaja has come down heavily against the campaign to tarnish the image of the Regional Cancer Centre RCC ), the premier hospital offering advanced treatment to cancer. She said that those with vested interests, who want to help the private hospital lobby, are behind the campaign.“The RCC is catering to lakhs of cancer patients across the state and such malicious campaigns will only destroy a world-class centre offering quality treatment,” the minister said.She said that there were isolated incidents but those were being blown out of proportion to tarnish the image of the hospital.“After the unfortunate incident that had led to the death of a nine-year-old girl who was under treatment for leukaemia, it was used as a campaign against the hospital. But all the tests had proved that it was not the fault of RCC. The hospital authorities had conducted repeat blood tests of the people who donated blood during that period. But a donor who was HIV positive could not be detected,” said the minister.It is a fact that there is no procedure in the country to find out the HIV positive cases during the window period, the minister added.Meanwhile, RCC director Dr Paul Sebastian also came out with a statement condemning the malicious campaign. “The hospital has adopted the WHO and National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) standards for the blood screening. It is also scientifically proven that all these tests cannot find out HIV positive cases during the window period. Even the latest tests like NAT cannot give exact results,” he said."

‘11 blood units found HIV-infected in ’17’: ‘11 blood units found HIV-infected in ’17’,2018-05-04,LUCKNOW,,"LUCKNOW:In 2017, as many as 11units of blood donated at the community blood bank of King George’s Medical University ( KGMU ) were found to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In past several years, only three to five units of HIV infected blood units had been timely detected annually.The rise implies that the number of HIV infected persons are increasing, and also that KGMU has been able to detect infected blood with much more precision by using the specialized Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT), than the previously used ELISA testing method to check donated blood for preventing infections via blood transfusion. Speaking at a programme on ‘Safe Blood Transfusion: Need of the Hour’, head of transfusion medicine department at KGMU, Prof Tulika Chandra said, “Blood transfusion runs a direct risk of contracting HIV if the blood is infected. We at KGMU have undertaken NAT since 2012. Since then, of the 3,10,000 units tested by NAT, 2,300 were found to be infected with HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C and were thus discarded.”But, it is not just 2,300 lives, that KGMU claims to have saved, depending on just conducting NAT on blood. “NAT helped save more than 9,000 lives by detecting 2,300 infected blood units that were discarded since four blood components would have been segregated from each unit, which equals to four patients and any one of this unit can be infected,” said Prof Chandra.She added that the number of HIV infected blood units has grown exponentially while cases of blood infected with Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B have gone down over the years.“There is an urgent need for blood transfusions to be made safe and the government should take note of this fact. Infected blood can be fatal if transfused to an ailing person. There is a phenomena called horizontal transfusion, which means that a person, transfused with infected blood, can give the infection to others in family through sexual and sometimes other means,” she added.Prof Chandra added that KGMU and SGPGIMS are the only centres using NAT while other government hospitals are still using the ELISA testing method.ELISA detects antibodies or antigens produced months after an infection is contracted and is thus futile for recent infections. NAT on the other hand, directly detects DNA or RNA of the infection causing virus present in the blood, making it more accurate."

"Our aim is to ensure nobody is deprived of healthcare due to lack of money, President says",2018-05-04,VELLORE,"News,City News,Chennai News","VELLORE: President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday said there is urgent need to fill the gap in the number of healthcare professionals in the country and to reform medical education.Inaugurating the centenary celebrations of medical education programmes at Christian Medical College (CMC) here, the President said, “In India, we have 15 lakh undergraduate engineering seats, but there are only 67,352 undergraduate medical seats. And about 20% of those seats have been added in the past four years. As a country and a system, we need to address this gap.”The principles that must guide our philosophy of public health are equity and efficiency, quality and quantity and access and affordability. Healthcare is a service. “Yes, it is also a business, but is no greater business than saving a life,” said the President and added that CMC community would agree to it.According to him, the country is facing three-pronged challenges in disease control -- reducing maternal and infant mortality as well as communicable disease, finding an answer to the rise in non-communicable or lifestyle disease and develop systems to detect and cope with new and re-emerging infectious diseases like HIV, avian flu and H1N1 influenza.“In a globalised world, with people travelling in and out of our country in larger and larger numbers, a few small cases can very quickly scale up to a large outbreak,” he said and continued that the three-pronged challenges call for interventions across the continuum of care. It calls for prevention of disease, promotion of good health practices and treatment and cure in case of an illness.The impact of a health problem is crosscutting and it affects a variety of sectors. To address this, there should be a multi-stakeholder approach from government to private and public health care providers, charitable and economic institutions.The national health mission, the national health policy and the Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme are alive to this broad-based approach. They aim is to ensure that nobody is deprived of healthcare due to the absence of financial or similar resources, said the president.Stating that Tamil Nadu has exceptional health indicators and remains a model for the country, he said that institutions like CMC have also contributed to this deserved reputation.Hailing Ida Sophia Scudder, the founder of CMC, the President said health indices were very poor and average life expectancy was just about 24-year in India when it was under colonial rule. One person died every minute of tuberculosis and one in four babies died in first year and epidemics and diseases were rampant and Independence was still a dream.“It was in such an India that Ida Sophia Scudder devoted her life to healthcare” and set up a medical school in 1918, he said and further said that the institution has a justifiable reputation for excellence.India’s first reconstructive surgery on leprosy patients was carried out in CMC and so was the first successful open heart surgery and the first kidney transplant, he said and also applauded the institute for taking up research on the rotavirus vaccine, hepatitis, malnutrition, bio-engineering and stem cells that underlines its commitment to research that is relevant to the country’s health needs.In his address, Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha P J Kurien said institutions like CMC should deserve support, encouragement and strengthening from the government.Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit released a book, ‘Healing for the Nation,’ as part of the celebration. Vellore district collector S A Raman, director of CMC Dr Peter and principal of the institution Dr Anna B Pulimood were also present.Later in the day, the president inaugurated the kidney transplant and cardiac unit in Sri Narayani Hospital and Research Centre and offered prayers at the Golden Temple. He planted saplings on the Golden Temple premises and took part in a yagam."

tamil nadu: Tamil Nadu loses track of 1 in 5 born with HIV,2018-05-07,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Civic Issues","CHENNAI: At 18 months, Saravanan* tested positive for HIV — a diagnosis that led his mother to take flight with the child to Madurai from their village near Namakkal. Nine years later, she can’t bury the report anymore: The boy, who looks half his age, has tuberculosis, a common disease among people living with HIV.Saravanan’s case is among those that have exposed the state government’s poor follow-up mechanism for children who test positive for HIV at birth. Statistics from Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society Tansacs ) show that of the 200 new cases of mother-to-child transmission detected in 2017, most were in the age group of 10 to 15.The data correlates with a study published last year by the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis. Researchers surveyed 656 children in Tamil Nadu in the 5-14 age group who registered for HIV care in 43 centres that offer antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. One in five of these children were lost to follow-up in a year.Children less than 15 years old constitute 7% of the HIV-infected in India. More than 90% of these cases are the result of mother-tochild transmission (MTCT). Doctors can say with certainty by the 18th month if an infant has got the virus from an infected mother, HIV specialist Dr S Sundar said. “The state loses its first opportunity of preventing transmission by putting infected mothers on ARV prophylaxis too late,” he said. Adequate ARV can reduce risk of MTCT to less than 2%. It misses a second opportunity after a child is diagnosed, Dr Sundar said.“In some instances, they may not show symptoms. There are chances that they will infect others as adults,” he said.Doctors say early diagnosis and initiation of ART in children less than two years of age is important as failure to do so may result in early mortality. As for the rest, a study published recently by doctors from the Institute of Child Health, Egmore, offers a telling picture.The team studied 100 children (18 months to 12 years) who were diagnosed with HIV in a government medical college in Salem: About 20% of children under the age of four died due to complications related to the disease, 25% of them had tuberculosis, 12% of them had problems with their central nervous system and 16% had blood-related disorders. Only 22 of them were asymptomatic.Dr Murali Thandavarayan , one of the authors, said besides clinical manifestations, a majority were malnourished. “HIV in children has faster progression because of immature immunity. Early identification and management is crucial,” he said.Officials say reasons for the loss to follow-up include unaccounted deaths, healthy children whose caregivers do not perceive the need to visit the ART centre, distance to these centres as well as the stigma involved.“Sometimes we find it difficult to track these children as the mothers deliver in their parents’ homes,” said Dr E Suresh , who heads the ART centre in ICH.Tansacs officials said they stepped up surveillance in the past six months. If children do not attend on the scheduled date, the outreach workers immdiately contact the family.*name changed"
"Star power propels organ donation drive, helps shoot up no. of pledges",2018-05-11,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: In 2014, as actor Aamir Khan gave mementos and certificates to families of cadaveric organ donors at a public function held in KEM Hospital in Parel, he could not hold back his tears.The families were no doubt touched by his humility and presence on that day, but what had a bigger and telling impact was his gesture of signing a giant donor card.“There was an immediate increase in the awareness levels about organ donations and number of people wanting to sign donor cards rose,” said the then ZTCC secretary general Dr Sujata Patwardhan , who had helped organise the ceremony. Aamir isn’t the only celebrity who has helped a struggling cause.“When actor Aishwarya Rai pledged to donate her eyes in 2010, there was a noticeable increase in the number of people who sought out information on how and where to donate eyes,” said nephrologist Dr Bharat Shah, who has regularly roped in celebrities for his NGO Narmada Kidney Foundation’s awareness drives.Actor Shammi Kapoor, who was himself a kidney failure patient, would regularly help Dr Shah with the awareness drives.Celebrity endorsers have a way of ‘lifting’ a cause. If actor Shabana Azmi stood up for destigmatising HIV/AIDS in the eighties, actor Amitabh Bachchan helped make the polio drive a success across the country.Medical journals have for the last two decades analysed how celebrity endorsements help health causes. Recently, Hollywood diva Angelina Jolie’s articles in The New York Times about her decision to undergo mastectomy (removal of breasts) and oophorectomy (removal of ovaries) led to an increase in the number of women going for genetic tests to detect breast and ovarian cancers.“Celebrities have a huge impact because people are willing to listen to their icons,” said Dr Shah. Indeed, when a hospital chain last year roped in cricketer Gautam Gambir to pledge his organs, there was a rise in the number of pledges. The Journal of Health Communication in 1995 observed that exposure to celebrities could have an important influece on the public’s health-related attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours.“The announcement by Los Angeles Lakers’ basketball star Magic Johnson that he tested positive for HIV infection was intended to promote HIV/ AIDS prevention, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Results indicate that those who had a greater degree of emotional involvement with Johnson were more likely to show an increase in their personal concern about AIDS, concern about the risk of AIDS to heterosexuals, and intention to reduce high-risk sexual behaviours,” the article said.But there is a flipside too: If it isn’t sustained, there is little long-term effect. “Simply knowing about Johnson by watching him play basketball, hearing him speak, or reading about him had no measurable impact on the public’s responses to his HIV disclosure,” noted the Health Communication article. Asenior doctor said celebrity endorsers have immediate, short-term effect. Dr Shah said, “Celebrity support has to be a continuous awareness drive. Only repeat endorsements create a lasting effect.”"

"Clinical psychologists to train psychology students, teachers in UP",2018-05-16,BAREILLY,"News,City News,Bareilly News","BAREILLY: The state government on Tuesday directed chief medical officers (CMOs) across UP to ask clinical psychologists and psychology social workers to regularly visit the psychology department of colleges in their respective district to train students and teachers on clinical psychology. The move is aimed at meeting the shortage of clinical psychologists in the state and utilizing their services later in counselling patients.An order to the effect was issued by UP mental health nodal officer Dr Sunil Pandey on Tuesday. He told TOI, “Under the National Mental Health Programme, clinical psychologists have to visit at least one college for training students and teachers of the psychology department. Only a few colleges in the state offer post-graduate course in clinical psychology while a majority of educational institutes give a post-graduate degree in psychology. The students of psychology currently lack proper information and if they are given proper training on identifying mental illness and counselling of patients, they can be an asset for us.’’According to officials, the training will help candidates to diagnose mental disorders, including depression, mania, mood disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and schizophrenia. They would be able to conduct personality judgment and IQ tests on students and provide counselling for drug and alcohol abuse, tobacco control, HIV and marital discord.Officials said clinical psychologists should pay at least one visit a week to collages and try to make maximum number of visits in the month. They have been directed to keep contact numbers of students.The country’s mental healthcare suffers from an acute shortage of staff. Minister of state for health and family welfare Anupriya Patel had informed Lok Sabha earlier this year that there are only 898 psychologists against 20,250 required in the country and less than 900 psychiatric social workers against the 37,000 needed. Also, as of January 2015, there were 3,827 psychiatrists against the 13,500 required in the country.According to the 2011 census, more than 7.22 lakh people across the country were suffering from “mental illness”, while over 15 lakh were “mentally retarted”. With 76,603 people suffering from some sort of mental illness, Uttar Pradesh tops the list of mentally ill patients in the country followed by West Bengal at 71,515, Kerala at 66,915 and Maharashtra at 58,753."

The figure is slightly higher than the national average of 0.34% for the age group 15-49 years.Dr Rajesh Gopal, additional project director, GSACS, said that the project was given to Gujarat due to its grassroots network for project implementation through the network - which primarily consists of persons living with HIV.“A two-day workshop of stakeholders was conducted in Ahmedabad on May 14 and 15 which was supported by WHO. Each partnering UN agency will focus on different aspects of the issue. For example, WHO will work on AIDS ART centres whereas UNODC will focus on de-addiction and so on,” he said, adding that now TB eradication has also been taken up along with the work for HIV+. Dr Gopal added that they have devised a plan to reach out to different regions and different groups of persons living with HIV+ in tailor-made way for effective implementation of the project."
tamil nadu: Tamil Nadu loses track of 1 in 5 born with HIV,2018-05-07,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Salem News","CHENNAI: At 18 months, Saravanan* tested positive for HIV — a diagnosis that led his mother to take flight with the child to Madurai from their village near Namakkal. Nine years later, she can’t bury the report anymore: The boy, who looks half his age, has tuberculosis, a common disease among people living with HIV.Saravanan’s case is among those that have exposed the state government’s poor follow-up mechanism for children who test positive for HIV at birth. Statistics from Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society Tansacs ) show that of the 200 new cases of mother-to-child transmission detected in 2017, most were in the age group of 10 to 15.The data correlates with a study published last year by the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis. Researchers surveyed 656 children in Tamil Nadu in the 5-14 age group who registered for HIV care in 43 centres that offer antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. One in five of these children were lost to follow-up in a year.Children less than 15 years old constitute 7% of the HIV-infected in India. More than 90% of these cases are the result of mother-tochild transmission (MTCT). Doctors can say with certainty by the 18th month if an infant has got the virus from an infected mother, HIV specialist Dr S Sundar said. “The state loses its first opportunity of preventing transmission by putting infected mothers on ARV prophylaxis too late,” he said. Adequate ARV can reduce risk of MTCT to less than 2%. It misses a second opportunity after a child is diagnosed, Dr Sundar said.“In some instances, they may not show symptoms. There are chances that they will infect others as adults,” he said.Doctors say early diagnosis and initiation of ART in children less than two years of age is important as failure to do so may result in early mortality. As for the rest, a study published recently by doctors from the Institute of Child Health, Egmore, offers a telling picture.The team studied 100 children (18 months to 12 years) who were diagnosed with HIV in a government medical college in Salem: About 20% of children under the age of four died due to complications related to the disease, 25% of them had tuberculosis, 12% of them had problems with their central nervous system and 16% had blood-related disorders. Only 22 of them were asymptomatic.Dr Murali Thandavarayan , one of the authors, said besides clinical manifestations, a majority were malnourished. “HIV in children has faster progression because of immature immunity. Early identification and management is crucial,” he said.Officials say reasons for the loss to follow-up include unaccounted deaths, healthy children whose caregivers do not perceive the need to visit the ART centre, distance to these centres as well as the stigma involved.“Sometimes we find it difficult to track these children as the mothers deliver in their parents’ homes,” said Dr E Suresh , who heads the ART centre in ICH.Tansacs officials said they stepped up surveillance in the past six months. If children do not attend on the scheduled date, the outreach workers immdiately contact the family.*name changed"
"HIV, TB intervention programme in Odisha prisons launched",2018-05-10,BHUBANESWAR,"News,City News,Bhubaneswar News","BHUBANESWAR: The state government on Wednesday launched a programme to test and treat prisoners with HIV, tuberculosis (TB). It will create awareness among them about the disease. The project will cover all the central jails , selected sub-jails/district jails and other closed settings like rehabilitation centres in the state. Health department sources said people living in prisons and other closed settings like Swadhar, Ujjawala and state-run homes are at an increased risk of HIV infection because they lack access to preventive and care services, making these settings a high-risk environment for HIV transmission.The National AIDS control organization (NACO), under its national AIDS control programme, categorized prisoners as one of the ‘special groups’. Section 31 of the HIV/AIDS (prevention and control) Act, 2017, stated that every person in the care and custody of the state shall have right to get HIV prevention, testing, treatment and counselling services.Besides this, NACO is also expanding the services to women living in other closed settings such as Swadhar, Ujjawala and state-run homes.Saathii, a non-profit organization, will implement this project with an objective to improve access and quality of HIV prevention, care and treatment services for people living in prisons and other closed settings.About the activities of the programme, health department sources said HIV testing and counselling services will be provided through mobile Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) and health camps in the prisons and other closed settings. This project will facilitate provision of HIV treatment, including antiretroviral therapy (ART), care and support to people living with HIV by establishing link with ART centres.It will also work for creating facilities for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB). “This programme will create awareness among the prisoners and people living with other closed settings,” said Pramod Kumar Meherda, state health secretary."
"WHO recommends scaling up access to testing, treatment for TB",2018-02-24,NEW DELHI,News,"NEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO), in its latest set of guidelines for combating tuberculosis, has recommended scaling up access to testing and treatment for the disease, especially among groups who are at risk, such as children and people with HIV.The recommendations also include two new shorter treatment regimens for latent TB infection (LTBI).The move is aimed at expanding access to testing and care for people with LTBI as they may develop active tuberculosis in the future if they do not receive appropriate treatment.The global health body said health practitioners have to prioritise testing and treatment of people living with HIV and children under the age of five who have been in contact with people who have TB.""WHO has now identified HIV-negative children aged more than or equal to 5 years, adolescents and adults who are contacts of TB patients, as well as contacts of patients with multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), as additional high-risk groups,"" the global health body said.It has recommended scaled-up testing for latent TB infection in both high and low TB-burden countries.According to WHO guidelines, a tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay can be used to test for latent TB infection and active TB disease should always be ruled out before prescribing preventive treatment.About the two new shorter treatment regimens for latent TB infection, WHO said, "" Rifapentine and isoniazid weekly for three months may be offered as an alternative to six months of isoniazid monotherapy as preventive treatment for both adults and children.""""Rifampicin plus isoniazid daily for three months should be offered as an alternative to six months of isoniazid monotherapy as preventive treatment for children and adolescents aged less 15 years. These shorter regimens will help patients adhere to their treatment and complete it,"" the world health body said.It is also releasing a mobile application to support programmatic management of latent TB infection.Dr Tereza Kasaeva , the director of WHO's Global TB Programme said, ""The new guidelines will help countries catalyse TB prevention and contribute to end the tuberculosis epidemic. Making sure everyone can obtain the treatment they need to prevent latent TB developing into active TB, will save lives and reduce suffering.""Scale-up of treatment to prevent has been slow and only 12 of the 30 countries with a high burden of HIV-associated TB, reported provision of tuberculosis preventive treatment among people living with HIV, said Dr Haileyesus Getahun , Coordinator for TB/HIV and community engagement, WHO Global TB Programme.Only 13 per cent of the 1.3 million eligible children received preventive treatment in 2016, Dr Getahun said.According to a WHO report last year, India topped the list of seven countries, accounting for 64 per cent of the 10.4 million new tuberculosis cases worldwide in 2016, .India has last year pledged its commitment to eliminate tuberculosis by 2025, five years ahead of the global goal to reduce the number of such deaths by 90 per cent by 2030.""We hope the new guidelines will disrupt the status quo in many countries and leapfrog global implementation of TB prevention efforts,"" Dr Getahun said.It would also contribute to global and national responses in finding and reaching those TB patients not in care, through systematic screening and testing.The guidelines are to be used primarily in national TB and HIV control programmes, or their equivalents in ministries of health, and for other policy-makers working on TB and HIV and infectious diseases, WHO said."

Testing for AIDS was one of the many services provided to the thousands who participated.The joint effort of the legal authority, state government departments and volunteers attracted over 5,000 people. Acting chief justice Gita Mittal of Delhi high court, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and judges of the high court and district and sessions courts were also present. “It is difficult to deliver this kind of assistance at the people's doorstep, so this collaboration with various state departments proved successful,” said a happy Sanjeev Jain, judge and DSLSA member-secretary.HIV testing was a special focus since the organisers felt that transgenders and commercial sex workers failed to get the attention and assistance they deserved. ""Camps like these are necessary for people who are unaware of their rights or cannot afford such assistance,"" said Chanderjit Singh, secretary, New Delhi Legal Services Authority.Despite an injured left arm in a sling, the enthusiasm of deputy director of the state AIDS control department, B C Joshi, did not slacken as he and his team tested 30 people for HIV.

KGMU: Blood from KGMU bank to cost more,2018-02-26,LUCKNOW,"News,City News,Lucknow News,Civic Issues","LUCKNOW: Patients taking blood from the blood bank in KGMU will now have to pay Rs 200 more, over the current Rs 400 per unit. The price hike has been effected because the department of transfusion medicine has been facing problems since the cost for conducting one test - the Nucleic Acid Test ( NAC ) - a molecular technique for screening blood donations to reduce the risk of transfusion transmitted infections in recipients, costs around Rs 1,000.Though the cost of NAC test per one unit of blood is around Rs 1,000, KGMU will only charge Rs 600 for a unit. KGMU would also not hike the rates for certain categories of patients. The department of transfusion medicine has sent a proposal of Rs 19 crores to the National Health Mission (NHM) for pre-transfusion testing, but it has yet to get a written approval for the same.""NHM has, in principle, accepted the proposal but there is no confirmation on how much money will be provided to us and when. Around 50% of our blood units are given for free to critical patients and it is only the remaining 50% that we can charge to make up for budgetary requirements,"" said head of the department, Prof Tulika Chandra.Even in these 50% cases, a number of patient categories would still be charged the old price of Rs 400 per unit. These categories include patients of diseases like cancer, thalassemia, HIV, the destitute, BPL and critical patients.“We have tried to keep the hike minimal. Even after the hike, the cost borne by KGMU for NAC testing on one unit is still more,” she added.On an average, the blood bank at KGMU gives 200 units of blood per day to patients for transfusion.Titan screen method in 2 months: In another two months, KGMU will start the Titan screen method of blood testing to eliminate presence of harmful antibodies in mutli-transfusion and elective surgery patients. “SGPGI is theonly medical facility in the state that currently does testing by this method, though it is done on manual mode.

government-run schools in Gurgaon: 65% students in Gurugram’s govt schools have exam stress: SCERT survey,2018-02-27,GURUGRAM,"News,City News,Gurgaon News","GURUGRAM: Exam stress affects around 65% students of government-run schools in Gurgaon , according to the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT), which conducted a state-wide survey on exam stress during November-December 2017. The results of the survey were released on Friday.The survey is part of a bigger survey on adolescents in the state, whose results are expected to be released next month. It consisted of four parts — general information about the children, their families and backgrounds, challenges they face while growing up (which includes exam stress) and their knowledge of HIV, drugs and sexual harassment. SCERT officials said the survey was conducted to know what kids were doing, what they were thinking and learning, and what authorities could do to improve their lives.According to the report, a majority of students in government schools across the state are stressed during examinations. While the percentage of students who are stressed in the entire state is around 61%, 65% of kids surveyed in Gurgaon said they were worried about not performing well in exams. Brahm Prakash, who led the survey, said: “It shows students see exams as a burden. Steps are being taken at the district level to ensure students don’t feel pressure during exams.”Carried out in 119 blocks in Gurgaon, 33,660 students — 14,467 boys and 19,193 girls — were given questionnaires to fill for the survey. Asked if they knew about stress, 72% said ‘yes’, 25% said ‘no’ and 4% gave no response. Around 19% were from urban backgrounds, whereas around 81% hailed from rural areas.Speaking about the survey, SCERT director Jyoti Choudhary said, “There is immense stress among students today. Parents are giving stress to kids. They don’t give them breaks between studies. Gaps in the teaching-learning process are not being filled. Parents only tend to criticise schools, but don’t care if their kids are learning effectively.”To beat stress, most students prefer listening to music. Around 64% of students in Gurgaon listen to music to beat stress, while the number was 65% in Faridabad. Some preferred to do other things to deal with stress — in the entire state, around 55% enjoyed listening to music, 25% read books and 20% preferred to play.Experts said to tackle exam stress, one should study for short intervals with breaks in between. “ Instead of studying overnight before exams, students should have a full night’s rest. A healthy diet with short breaks between studies is also important,” said Shweta Sharma, clinical psychologist, Columbia Asia hospital.Career counsellor Hema Gupta also spoke to TOI about various methods for students to succeed in exams. “Most parents worry their kids won’t score high marks or that their colleagues’ kids will perform better. There is intense competition among students these days. It’s essential parents maintain calm and not add to the kid’s stress. Students should self-assess and solve sample papers before exams.”"

Clinics of 73 quacks sealed in HIV affected Bangarmau,2018-02-11,BANGARMAU,"News,City News,Lucknow News","BANGARMAU: Health authorities have taken action against 73 quacks by sealing their clinics in various localities of Bangarmau tehsil in Unnao district following spread of HIV in three villages due to alleged treatment by a quack.“As many 73 clinics of alleged quacks have been sealed. An FIR is being registered against three quacks while notices are being served to 44 others, who have been unable to produce degrees or relevant documents for running clinics,” Unnao chief medical officer (CMO) Dr S P Chowdhary told TOI on Saturday.“If ‘doctors’ are not registered with the Medical Council of India, they have no right to practice medicine. We are taking action on complaints of quackery,” the CMO added.An official spokesman said while some of these quacks were operating from their houses, others had opened clinics.“Officials have been asked to verify the credentials of the quacks who run advertisements on local TV channels in the district. The health department teams will also request cable operators to stop advertisements promoting tantriks and quacks,” he added.Meanwhile, HIV affected people of the three villagers of Bangarmau — Prem Ganj, Chakmir and Kirmidiyapur — have demanded setting up of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) link centre at Bangarmau community health centre (CHC) to facilitate cheap and affordable treatment.At present, patients are being treated at the ART centre of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) medical college in Kanpur. ART is a therapy that improves the life quality of HIV patients with treatment that maximally suppresses the HIV virus.“My 10-year-old daughter is HIV positive,” said Vinay (name changed), describing how his entire family makes a three-hour-long journey from Premganj where they live to the medical college in Kanpur every month.“My daughter depends on antiretroviral therapy given at the ART centre to keep living. We can’t afford the fare any longer. It would be better if the authorities establish a link centre at Bangarmau CHC itself,” said Vinay.His views were echoed by Sudarshan (name changed), a truck driver and a father of a 12-year-old HIV positive son. Residents of Chakmir, Sudarshan and his wife travel to Kanpur every month for treatment of their son and the bus ride costs Rs 800 per trip.“The amount spent on travelling to the nearest ART centre should be reimbursed. Moreover, the government should set up a link centre here, else I would have no option but to skip treatment,” he said.Local social activists said what is worrying is that of the total 58 HIV positive cases identified so far during screening in the three villages, only 25 have visited the ART centre.“ART treatment can’t cure HIV/AIDS . There is still no outright cure for the disease, and it does not go away by itself. But ARTs do slow down the damage that the virus does to the immune system, and allow people to live long, productive lives like everyone else, without succumbing to the disease,” said an activist.A senior health official at ART centre, meanwhile, said there were several reasons why patients avoid medication. “They usually do not want to reveal their condition to their near and dear ones. Many skip the treatment out of the fear that others will find out about their condition,” he said.At least 58 persons tested positive for HIV in Bangarmau after a quack allegedly used infected syringes to treat scores of his patients. Of these, 33 were detected at a blood donation camp on February 3 while 25 had come to light last year."
Japanese Encephalitis: Govt draws flak for poor health record,2018-02-11,Bhubaneswar,"News,City News,Bhubaneswar News,Civic Issues","Bhubaneswar: The BJP and Congress on Saturday took potshots at the state government for slipping to 18th position from the earlier 16th in the latest health index published by NITI Aayog recently. The parties said the state has performed poorly in neonatal mortality and low-birth weight of newborns. OPCC president Prasad Harichandan said the state government makes tall claims by coming up with some policies or guidelines in the health sector. But it failed to implement those in letter and spirit, he added. ""It is unfortunate that the state can't perform well in health indices even after 18 years of the BJD government. The NITI Aayog report proves the government's failure on the health front,"" said Harichandan.BJP vice-president Sameer Mohanty said performance of the state is not satisfactory in bringing down the neo-natal mortality rate or low birth weight of newborns and improvement in immunisation coverage or access of HIV patients to anti-retro viral therapy. ""If the health index falls from 16th to 18th rank, it shows the state government has not brought about any significant development in the health sector between 2014-15 and 2015-16,"" he said.""We have been hearing about the death of children from Japanese Encephalitis in Malkangiri and delivery of babies by pregnant women on road or near hospital due to lack of ambulance service or medical bed,"" said Mohanty.He said Dana Majhi episode exposed the state's helplessness.

Narendra Modi: Big Modi govt push for health? Key schemes face cut in funds,2018-02-12,NEW DELHI,"News,BUSINESS NEWS,India Business News","NEW DELHI: Contrary to the impression of an increased focus on health in the budget for 2018-19, not only has the overall allocation for health gone up only marginally over the revised estimates for the current year, the allocation for important programmes has actually been slashed. For instance, the allocation for the National Health Mission is down by 2.1 per cent coming down from Rs 31,292 crore to Rs 30,634 crore.Moreover, while the budget speech said the new initiative for upgrading 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres’ envisioned as “the foundation of India’s health system” was being allocated Rs 1,200 crore, a reading of the detailed expenditure budget shows that this too is coming out of the NHM outlay. If this amount were to be excluded, the NHM budget would be almost 6 per cent less than the current year’s.Thus, some continuing programmes under NHM will get less funds than they did. In any case, Rs 1,200 crore may be too little to fund 1.5 lakh such centres, according to Dr T Sundararaman, Dean of the school of health systems studies at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences.“A health and wellness centre requires, by current government projections, about Rs 17 lakh to operationalise and so Rs 1,200 crore would pay for only about 10,000 of these,” he pointed out. He also noted that this was similar to finance minister Arun Jaitley’s announcement of a National Dialysis Programme in the 2016-17 budget to ensure that every district hospital dialysis facilities.About 2,000 new dialysis centres were to be started but there was no separate allocation for it. That too was to come from NHM money. While Jaitley’s budget speech this year announced the setting up of 24 new government medical colleges and hospitals by upgrading existing district hospitals, the budget allocation for this head was slashed from Rs 3,300 crore in the current year to Rs 2,888 crore in 2018-19, a decline of 12.5 per cent.Another important central sector scheme is the National AIDS and STD Control Programme. The outlay for this too is down about 3 per cent from Rs Rs 2,163 in RE 2017-18 to Rs 2,100. There have been frequent reports of HIV drugs being unavailable suggesting that even the amount spent this year was inadequate. Yet, funding will be further down on this crucial central public health programme.Allocation for the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY), which is for setting up AIIMS-like institutions and upgrading existing medical colleges, was slashed from Rs 3,975 crore in the budget estimates for 2017-18 to Rs 3,825 crore, a decline of about 4 per cent.However, the allocation is 20 per cent more than in the RE for the current year. Six AIIMS are functional though with several deficiencies in infrastructure and faculty shortage. Yet, governments have announced new AIIMS in every budget."
HIV counselling centres hit by staff crunch,2018-02-12,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Civic Issues","CHENNAI: HIV-positive patients in Chennai could be slipping through the state’s tracking system with the counselling and testing centers for them struggling to function with skeletal staff in the city.Chennai has 46 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC), the highest in the state. Of this, 42 are under the Chennai Corporation and four are monitored directly by Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society (TANSACS).However, with HIV featuring bottom-most in the city health department’s priority list -- following a drop in prevalence over the years -- counsellors at various ICTCs complain that lab technicians in these centers are often deputed to other departments in Corporation hospitals. “Screening is often affected in the process,” said a counsellor. “Patients are either asked to wait or return later, but they rarely do as most of them are part of a floating population,” she said.The 42 ICTCs under corporation are managed by Chennai Corporation AIDS Prevention and Control Society ( CAPACS ), a body set up by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) in the late 90s, along with similar city-wings in Mumbai and Ahmedabad. In 2016, NACO, following a decline in HIV prevalence in Ahmedabad and Chennai, wrote to the state AIDS control societies in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu asking them to merge the city-specific operations with the state.A senior official in TANSACS said of the Rs 69 crore the state receives every year from NACO, at least Rs 6.9 crore goes for paying salaries of around 100 CAPACS staff. “The department is cash-strapped right now with NACO slashing funds. CAPACS is an additional burden,” he said.Besides, financial difficulties, officials say the merger will also benefit HIV patients. “Besides helping us monitor these centres better, we can also fill the vacancies by deputing staff from ICTCs in other districts where the prevalence is low,” he said. Another official said the city AIDS control society was set up at a time when these centers were available only in Chennai. “Now we have sufficient testing centers in the districts. The body is now obsolete,” he said.At present, there are 1,264 ICTCs and 55 antiretroviral therapy centers for HIV/AIDS people in Tamil Nadu. The state has 1.43 lakh people living with HIV and sees around 3,000-4,000 new cases a year. The state has a current prevalence rate of 0.28%, just above the national rate of 0.27%.Chennai Corporation officials said they are preparing a proposal for the merger which will be placed before CAPACS’s general body. Sources say the move is likely to face opposition from CAPACS."

Japanese Encephalitis: Govt draws flak for poor health record,2018-02-11,Bhubaneswar,"News,City News,Cuttack News","Bhubaneswar: The BJP and Congress on Saturday took potshots at the state government for slipping to 18th position from the earlier 16th in the latest health index published by NITI Aayog recently. The parties said the state has performed poorly in neonatal mortality and low-birth weight of newborns. OPCC president Prasad Harichandan said the state government makes tall claims by coming up with some policies or guidelines in the health sector. But it failed to implement those in letter and spirit, he added. ""It is unfortunate that the state can't perform well in health indices even after 18 years of the BJD government. The NITI Aayog report proves the government's failure on the health front,"" said Harichandan.BJP vice-president Sameer Mohanty said performance of the state is not satisfactory in bringing down the neo-natal mortality rate or low birth weight of newborns and improvement in immunisation coverage or access of HIV patients to anti-retro viral therapy. ""If the health index falls from 16th to 18th rank, it shows the state government has not brought about any significant development in the health sector between 2014-15 and 2015-16,"" he said.""We have been hearing about the death of children from Japanese Encephalitis in Malkangiri and delivery of babies by pregnant women on road or near hospital due to lack of ambulance service or medical bed,"" said Mohanty.He said Dana Majhi episode exposed the state's helplessness. ""We have been raising health issues many times but the state government does not pay heed to our demands,"" he added.BJD spokesperson Pratap Deb said the BJP and Congress are bringing political allegations against the state government. ""They don't want to know the real picture of development. Centre has praised the state for polio vaccination and other health measures taken by our government. We are in the process of coming up with several new initiatives in the health sector,"" he added."
"No toilet, HIV+ people being stopped from open defecation",2018-02-12,BANGARMAU,"News,India News","BANGARMAU: Stigma continues to haunt the people in Bangarmau town of Unnao which is under the spotlight after detection of about 58 people carrying HIV.In Prem Ganj, one of the three villages where 38 had been found HIV positive, majority of houses don’t have toilet. Those with the infection are now being stopped from defecating in the fields by influential local people. Gangadeen , 54, who has been found HIV positive and lives on the outer part of Prem Ganj along with his four children, only wishes to have a toilet in his house which would not only prevent him from relieving in the open, but avoid wrath of ‘powerful’ locals.“We can’t use farmlands because they fear that they too will contract the virus,” said Gangadeen. “Rich and mighty have built toilets in their homes but the poor people like us cannot afford it,” said Bhanu , 45, another HIV positive from Prem Ganj.“There are no toilets in our houses and we have to use either the area near the farms to relieve ourselves or railway tracks. Powerful and mighty people stop us from defecating in their fields, while Railway Protection Force book us for tresspassing. It seems toilets are meant only for ‘rich’ and not for poor people like us,” says Parmanand, 60, another HIV positive.When contacted, an influential farmer said they cannot allow HIV positive people to use their farmlands for defecation. “They have already ruined their lives. If we will allow them, they will spread HIV virus and ruin us and our future generations,” he said."

Anti-trafficking Bill likely to be tabled in Parliament next month,2018-02-12,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: The anti-trafficking Bill, which proposes that NIA probe human trade, is likely to be tabled in Parliament next month, the Women and Child Development Ministry said.A group of ministers constituted to examine the Draft Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2017 met late last month and gave its nod to the proposed legislation.The group comprises ministries of external affairs, law and justice, housing and urban affairs and, women and child development.According to a statement from the women and child development ministry, the draft bill would be submitted to the Cabinet this week and following its approval, it is likely to be tabled in Parliament in the second part of the Budget session, slated to start on March 5.In November last year, PTI had reported that National Investigation Agency (NIA), the apex anti-terror body, could be empowered to investigate cases of human trafficking after a breakthrough in the nearly year-long consultations among various ministries.""The draft says that NIA will be the body which will probe cases of human trafficking,"" a senior official of the ministry of women and child development said.He said a cell within the NIA would receive financial aid under Nirbhaya Fund created for women's safety.Government officials say that in order to empower the NIA to probe trafficking cases the National Investigation Act, 2008, will have to be amended.The NIA was set up by the UPA government in 2009 to probe terrorist activities in the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which killed 166 people.According to the National Investigation Act, the anti- terror body is empowered to probe offences under eight specified laws, including the Atomic Energy Act 1962, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967, and the Anti- Hijacking Act 1982.The proposed legislation on trafficking divides various offences into ""trafficking"" and ""aggravated trafficking"". The former category of crimes would carry a jail term of between seven and 10 years.For 'aggravated trafficking' offences the punishment would be not less than 10 years in jail, which can be extended to life imprisonment.These offences include forced labour, bonded labour, forced surrogacy, use of narcotics to induce forced labour, trafficking in the garb of marriage and those that lead to a grave illness such as HIV/AIDS or pregnancy.The draft bill also moots life imprisonment for repeat offenders and three years in jail for abetting, promoting and assisting trafficking.It recommends a national anti-trafficking relief and rehabilitation committee which would be headed by Secretary of Women and Child Development ministry.It also proposes setting up of a rehabilitation fund and prescribes a process to be followed for repatriation of trafficked persons."
Mumbai Lab: Mumbai lab will be hub of free viral load tests for HIV,2018-02-13,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News,Civic Issues News","MUMBAI: A laboratory from the eastern suburbs will be at the centre of the Union health ministry’s mission to bring about a path-breaking shift in HIV care as it sets out to test viral loads of over 1.2 million positive patients over the next three years.Viral load testing, which has long become the gold standard to monitor HIV treatment and disease progression the world over, will now be offered free of cost at 525 anti-retroviral centres across the country, including 84 from the state, by the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). Previously, the test used to be offered to 20,000 people following a tedious process of selection stretching into months. Several long-term HIV patients could not afford the test as it costs Rs 7,000 in private labs.This February, NACO entered into a public-private partnership with Metropolis Healthcare. Under the arrangement, samples from Jammu & Kashmir to southern India and north-eastern states will be flown to the city and tested at the lab’s Vidyavihar facility. In the first year, two lakh samples will be tested, which would be doubled in the second year and tripled in the third to cover all 1.2 million Indians living on antiretroviral treatment (ART).Initially, all ART centres from Mumbai will be extended the service, though there will be prioritizing of patients. It will be scaled up subsequently to include more ART centres as the collection and transportation of samples is streamlined.“Our programme has so far relied on the CD4 (immunity) count, which essentially tells us how much damage the virus has caused already. We need the viral load testing to see if a regimen is effective, and promptly shift a patient to the second or third line therapy if it’s not,” said Dr Naresh Goel, deputy director general of NACO. He added the tests will be carried out at a cumulative cost of Rs 150 crore. Dr Nilesh Shah, president of Metropolis, said samples would be flown in a temperature-controlled environment for quality and to prevent any mishaps. “Even those from remotest parts should reach city under 48 hours,” he said, adding that reports be emailed to respective centres. BMC’s executive health officer Dr Padmaja Keskar said patients who are failing the first line therapy, pregnant women and lactating mothers will be given priority. “Once someone is detected with a high viral load, the case will be referred to Byculla’s J J Hospital for treatment,” she said. The city has around 37,000 people on ART. Ganesh Acharya, who has lived with HIV for two decades, welcomed the facility but added that NACO should make it routinely available."
"tested positive for hiv: Fearing boycott, locals use fake names at counselling",2018-02-13,KANPUR,"News,City News,Kanpur News","KANPUR: The locals of Bangarmau have started faking their identity at Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) fearing that if tested positive for HIV , either their employers would fire them or they would face ostracism by the villagers.The issue came to fore on Friday when nearly seven locals from Bangarmau reached ICTC Hasanganj and got themselves enrolled for the blood test.“It was when all the seven persons were tested negative, they disclosed to the ICTC staff that they had faked their identity owing to social stigma,” said a staff of ICTC.“They said that not only they fear social boycott from the locals but even by their employer, who might ask them to look for work elsewhere,” he added.To overcome the issue, the health department in the three villages will soon start an awareness drive to identify HIV positive persons in collaboration with UPSACS ( UttarPradesh Aids Control Society ), said a senior health official.“We have come to know about people faking their identity through ICTC staff. Though it is a bit disturbing, but we will try to convince them. We will create awareness through street plays, graphics and pictures, which are easy to understand as most of them are uneducated,” said nodal officer AK Rawat.“Usually, the field workers mingle with the people and seek their help to get friendly with the suspected HIV positive cases. Once they are identified, they are told how HIV spreads, and that it is not something to hide or be ashamed of. We will guide them about the ways to keep them and their near and dear ones fit,” said the nodal officer.Elaborating about functioning of the ICTC, a health officer told TOI that the staff members fill up a form with personal details such as home address so that the person can be tracked for treatment in case he/she does not turn up after testing HIV positive.Thereafter, doctors ask them about any illness they may have, and give them medicines.Later, paramedical staff collects the person’s blood samples, the results of which come out in halfan hour.He further said each of the six men is taken to the counsellor who advises them on the use of condoms and tells them to visit an ART clinic in case they test positive.A CD4 count is then taken at the ART Centre, and if it is less than 500, the patient is treated as per the standard norms, he added."
HIV patients: Over 500 patients in Maharashtra contracted HIV via infected needles in 5 years: RTI,2018-02-09,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News,Civic Issues News","MUMBAI: Transmission of HIV through infected needles doesn’t seem to be restricted to villages in Uttar Pradesh alone. Patients in Maharashtra too have, over the years, claimed to have contracted HIV through infected needles or syringes.An RTI response from National Aids Control Society (NACO) showed that over 500 people in the state have got HIV through infected needles. Between 2012-13 and 2016-17, 512 disclosed at Integrated Centres for Testing and Counselling (ICTCs) that exposure to infected needle was responsible for the infection, said RTI activist Chetan Kothari. Numbers suggest an average 70-200 people get HIV through infected needles every year. In 2017-18, 69 people, including 29 women, contracted the infection.But the numbers have been highly debated by state agencies working towards controlling the disease. Parimal Sinh, who heads the state Aids control society, said less than 0.5% of new infections are due to infected needles. Over 90% of the infection in the state happens through the heterosexual route.“More importantly, the needle-infection numbers are based on voluntary disclosures made by people during counselling sessions before and after they are tested for HIV in ICTCs. Often, patients tend to suggest blood transfusion and infection through needles as possible mode of transmission. While our counsellors try to find out the exact reason, we also have to keep in mind the mental state of the patient.”Medically too, a single needle usage may not necessarily mean transmission of HIV. Eldred Tellis of Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, that has been working with intravenous drug users (IDUs), said the virus could survive for three hours in the bore of a needle as there is vacuum, but otherwise it would die within 10 seconds. “But since HIV is a weak virus, the viral load of the infected person has to be really high for transmission. Studies suggest that one in 10 persons will get HIV if the needle is infected.”Interestingly, the highest HIV prevalence (7%) in the country is among IDUs, who use addictive substances through injections by exchanging needles. “In most cases, they pull out blood and put it back in the syringe to extract maximum of the drug and inject into veins contributing to high HIV infection,” he said. Tellis added that the authorities must also think of hepatitis C infection as that transmits more efficiently than HIV. “In Mumbai IDUs, hepatitis prevalence is around 35%, whereas HIV is 9.5%,” he said."

The overall ranking was decided on three broad categories—health outcomes (indicator), governance and processes.While Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh are the top three ranking states in terms of annual incremental performance, Rajasthan’s incremental performance was just moderate and not enough to improve its ranking. In comparison to base year (2014-15), Rajasthan’s overall performance index score increased by 2 points from 35 to 37. “Despite increases in the composite health index scores, the rankings of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh , Bihar, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh did not change between base and reference years,” says the report.The state’s incremental rank is 8th in the country. Since all the other states except UP already have much better scores than Rajasthan, the moderate incremental change (2 points) did not help the state in improving its ranking.Even though the incremental changes for Kerala, Gujarat , Himachal Pradesh are negative, they have secured the 1st, 4th and 5th ranks, respectively. Kerala is at the top with 77 points in the overall performance index score.“The top five performing States for the reference year, based on the composite index score, are Kerala (76.55), Punjab (65.21), Tamil Nadu (63.38), Gujarat (61.99), and Himachal Pradesh (61.20). On the other end of the spectrum, Uttar Pradesh (33.69) scored the lowest and ranks at the bottom preceded by Rajasthan (36.79), Bihar (38.46), Odisha (39.43), and Madhya Pradesh (40.09),” says the NITI Aayog report.However, the report says “for the health outcomes domain (health indicators), Kerala is ranked at the top and Rajasthan at the bottom, while for key inputs/processes, Tamil Nadu earned the top position while Uttar Pradesh received the lowest ranking.”The health outcome index score of the state has slipped by one point from 30 to 29 (from 2014-15 to 2015-16). The incremental change of health outcome has gone negative in the state. In 2014-15, the state stood at the second last position with 20th rank and UP came last. But, UP has now secured 7 points (incremental change) and moved up to 20th rank while Rajasthan slipped into last position.But the state has improved drastically in key inputs/processes domain, which is one of the three factors on which the rankings of states have been decided. With an addition of 17 more points, Rajasthan achieved the highest incremental change in this category. In key inputs/process domain, it has secured 10th rank among 21 bigger states.Box: The Criteria*Overall performance ranking of states depends on —health outcomes (indicators), key inputs/processes and governance and information*Under governance and information comes data integrity of institutional deliveries, first trimester ante-natal check-up registration, average occupancy of three key posts (principal secretary health, director of national health mission and health director) and average occupancy of chief medical officer in months*Under key inputs/processes come vacancy of auxiliary nurse midwives, senior nurses, medical officers, specialists at district hospitals, percentage of functional first reference units, primary health centres, cardiac units, birth registration, first trimester antenatal check-ups, etc.*Health outcomes (indicators) cover neonatal mortality rates, under-five mortality rate, total fertility rate, percentage of children with low birth weight, sex ratio at birth, etc.Box: Points to Ponder*NITI Aayog report says that the number of girls born for every 1,000 boys has deteriorated most, and slipped from 893 to 861 from base year to reference year (2014-15 to 2015-16).*Full immunization (percentage) and institutional deliveries (percentage) has deteriorated from 79 to 78 and 75 to 74, respectively.

Six out of 21 big states show decline in health indicators,2018-02-10,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: Six of India's 21 largest states registered a decline in health indicators between 2014-15 and 2015-16 though most improved, a Niti Aayog report ranking states on health parameters showed. While those slipping included top ranked Kerala, what was worrying was that they also included Haryana and Uttarakhand , which were already quite low in the rankings.Uttar Pradesh was the worst performer among the 21 states as per the Aayog's Health Index Rankings. Kerala, unsurprisingly, was on top followed by Punjab and Tamil Nadu . The good news for UP was that it was among the three most improved states, though still at the bottom. Jharkhand and J&K registered even better improvements in their scores, but Jharkhand still remained in the bottom half of the rankings at No.14, while Jammu & Kashmir was ranked 7 .The poor show on overall ranking and slow pace of improvement on the health front reflects the massive challenge before UP chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath, who came to power in March 2017, to push the state machinery into action to catch up with performers on critical heath parameters.The performance of states was judged on health outcomes from base year (2014-15) to reference year (2015-16) on indicators such as neonatal mortality rate, under-five mortality rate, full immunisation coverage, institutional deliveries and people living with HIV on anti-retroviral therapy. The ranking is a weighted composite index based on indicators in three domains - health outcomes (70% weightage), governance and information (12%), and key inputs and processes (18%).The 'Healthy States, Progressive India' report noted that states that started at lower levels of development were generally at an advantage in notching incremental progress over states with high health index scores. ""It is a challenge for states with high index scores to even maintain their performance levels,"" it said. In that context, Punjab's performance was creditable as it jumped three places to knock Tamil Nadu off from second place.Ranking was done in three categories - larger states, smaller states and Union Territories - to ensure comparison among similar entities."
Stigma of HIV makes people quit UP villages,2018-02-10,BANGARMAU (UNNAO),"News,City News,Lucknow News,Civic Issues","BANGARMAU (UNNAO): Panic among the residents of Unnao villages under the grips of an HIV scare is driving many to relocate over fears of banishment.Mukesh* of Premganj is one of them. His elder sister was engaged to a man from the neighbouring Hardoi district and the family happily making arrangements for the wedding. But the would be in-laws of his sister have stopped taking their calls since the news of HIV infections in Premganj and two adjoining villages made headlines. When Mukesh tried to contact them through a mediator, they called off the match. “No one in my family is infected, but moving away seems to be the only option left for us. Otherwise who will marry my siblings, including four sisters?” Mukesh asked.Shivam (45), a class-IV civic employee, lives with his mother (80). Both tested negative for HIV, but he feels ostracised by relatives. Life is no better at work either. “My colleagues have started ignoring me,” he said.Ratnesh (28) tested positive and is devastated. A Class VIII dropout, he lives with his two sisters and parents in Premganj and works as a “palledar” in Galla Mandi. “A grocer refused to sell things to me. My friend has suggested I shift from here. I know the time has come to leave Premganj,” he said.However, Unnao chief medical officer S P Chowdhary said there was no need for panic. Health teams will hold check-up camps, where counsellors will be available, with ‘nukkad natak’ teams roped in as well to spread awareness, he said."

"NITI Aayog releases 'Healthy States, Progressive India' report",2018-02-10,PUNE,"News,India News","PUNE: NITI Aayog released on Saturday a comprehensive Health Index report titled, “Healthy States, Progressive India” which has highlighted that Kerala, Punjab and Tamil Nadu ranked on top in terms of overall performance. The report ranks states and Union territories innovatively on their year-on-year incremental change in health outcomes, as well as, their overall performance with respect to each other. The report was released jointly by the CEO, NITI Aayog; Amitabh Kant, Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare; Preeti Sudan and World Bank India Country Director, Junaid Ahmad. The report is the first attempt to establish an annual systematic tool to measure and understand the heterogeneity and complexity of the nation’s performance in Health.The report has been developed by NITI Aayog, with technical assistance from the World Bank, and in consultation with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW),The Health Index is a weighted composite Index, which for the larger States, is based on indicators in three domains: (a) Health Outcomes (70%); (b) Governance and Information (12%); and (c) Key Inputs and Processes (18%), with each domain assigned a weight based on its importance.Among the Larger States, Kerala, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu ranked on top in terms of overall performance, while Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir, and Uttar Pradesh are the top three ranking States in terms of annual incremental performance. Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir, and Uttar Pradesh showed the maximum gains in improvement of health outcomes from base to reference year in indicators such as Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR), Under-five Mortality Rate (U5MR), full immunization coverage, institutional deliveries, and People Living with HIV (PLHIV) on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART).Among Smaller States, Mizoram ranked first followed by Manipur on overall performance, while Manipur followed by Goa were the top ranked States in terms of annual incremental performance.Manipur registered maximum incremental progress on indicators such as PLHIV on ART, first trimester antenatal care (ANC) registration, grading quality parameters of Community Health Centres (CHCs), average occupancy of key State-level officers and good reporting on the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP).Among UTs, Lakshadweep showed both the best overall performance as well as the highest annual incremental performance. Lakshadweep showed the highest improvement in indicators such as institutional deliveries, tuberculosis (TB) treatment success rate, and transfer of National Health Mission (NHM) funds from State Treasury to implementation agency.The Health Index report notes that while States and UTs that start at lower levels of development are generally at an advantage in notching up incremental progress over States with high Health Index scores, it is a challenge for States with high Index scores to even maintain their performance levels. For example, Kerala ranks on top in terms of overall performance but sees the least incremental change as it had already achieved a low level of Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) and Under-five Mortality Rate (U5MR) and replacement level fertility, leaving limited space for any further improvements.However, the incremental measurement reveals that about one-third of the States have registered a decline in their performance in 2016 as compared to 2015, stressing the need to pursue domain-specific, targeted interventions. Common challenges for most States and UTs include the need to focus on addressing vacancies in key staff, establishment of functional district Cardiac Care Units (CCUs), quality accreditation of public health facilities and institutionalization of Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS). Additionally, almost all Larger States need to focus on improving the Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB)."
"Absent doctors, vacancies, decrepit PHCs aiding quackery in UP",2018-02-11,AGRA,"News,City News,Agra News","AGRA: Two days ago, 23-year-old Vimlesh who had been running high fever died in her native village, Mahuvan in Mathura, hours after she was administered medicines prescribed by a quack. Her husband, Puran Singh , said the nearest community centre in Farah is 3 km away and one rarely finds a doctor there. Going to the quack, who had been running an allopathic clinic in the village for many years, was not a matter of choice for them. Vimlesh’s death comes close on the heels of the Unaao incident where local residents were infected with HIV by a quack, who used the same syringe on multiple patients without sterilizing it. The two incidents have once again exposed the menace of quacks in UP.With most of UP hospitals, particularly in rural areas, suffering from acute shortage of doctors and specialists, and rampant absenteeism, quacks across the state are having a field day, playing with the lives of thousands of patients daily. There is also the fact that quacks dispense treatment cheap, in some cases for as little as Rs 10, forcing many of the state's poor to head to them.According to officials of the health department, 40% posts of government doctors are lying vacant in the state. Only 11,034 doctors are working against the sanctioned strength of 18,382 posts.Similarly, 60% posts of specialists, like gynaecologists and pediatricians, are lying vacant in government health institutes as only 3,000 of them are working against the sanctioned strength of 7,300.There are 7,000 vacancies of government doctors in the state. “The unavailability of registered medical practitioners in rural areas forces people to take the services of quacks,” admit officials.Agra district alone has around 2,000 quacks. According to Agra’s deputy CMO and nodal officer , Dr Ajay Kapoor , 1500-2000 quacks have been identified in Agra district. Similarly, 2,000 of them have been identified in Mathura district and nearly 500 in Aligarh. But government figures peg the numbers at far less.Dr Padmakar Singh , director general (medical health), in response to the state government’s order to provide information on quacks, said 14 of 75 districts have identified 621 quacks in all. Notably, some of these districts — Allahabad, Fatehpur, Kausambhi, Ambedkar Nagar, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Orai, Chitrakoot, Mahoba, Hamirpur, Sitapur, Gautambuddh Nagar, Moradabad and Ghazipur – are among the most populous and backward ones in the state.Singh said that he is going to issue a circular to all districts to conduct a special campaign to curb this menace by taking action against quacks. With negligible presence of healthcare in rural hinterland, however, this is easier said than done."
18 preliminary HIV+ cases identified at 'gram samvedana',2018-02-18,KOLHAPUR,"News,City News,Kolhapur News","KOLHAPUR: The District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), Kolhapur has identified as many as 18 preliminary HIV positive cases in the on-going 'gram samvedana', an awareness campaign being conducted across 65 villages from February 6.DAPCU programme officer Deepa Shipurkar said that as many as 12,000 screenings have been conducted in the last 11 days in the rural and remote areas of the district. Shipurkar said those cases, which have been tested positive, have to undergo further tests to get the accurate result.She added that these patients will be counselled at an integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) before starting any treatment.According to Shipurkar, Kolhapur district has 3-4 major industrial areas besides the textile business of Ichalkaranji. These industrial enterprises are major hubs of employment generation. People from at least 100km periphery migrate to Kolhapur in search of jobs, most of who are HIV positive.Another aspect unique to Kolhapur district is the seasonal migration of sugarcane cutters from Marathwada , north Maharashtra and Karnataka between October and April. DAPCU conducts regular awareness campaigns and screenings to find out prevalence of sexually-transmitted diseases among the sugarcane cutters, she said.At least one lakh people, mostly men, migrate to Kolhapur during the sugarcane cutting season. Previous reports have pointed out that unconventional working hours, heavy load, liquor consumption and unprotected sexual activity among a host of other factors others make them vulnerable to HIV.Shipurkar further said during Gam Samvedana , it has been found that people who travel to metro cities in search of work, contracted the virus there.She added all HIV positive patients should opt for Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) which they can avail at the four hospitals in the district. Patients are counselled at ICTCs before being administered treatment. After a range of blood tests, the patient whose CD4 count is less than 500, he has to take treatment throughout his life.However, the norm has been relaxed now. The CD4 count is an indicator of how well the body's immune system is working.She added that it is a growing concern that the disease is more prevalent in the remote areas of the district. Awareness campaigns will be increased in the coming days."
HIV-affected Bangarmau town: Fatehpur’s ‘HIV village’ has seen no fresh case in 5 years,2018-02-19,UDAI SARAI (Fatehpur),"News,City News,Lucknow News,Civic Issues","UDAI SARAI (Fatehpur): Residents of this small village in Fatehpur district would empathise with HIV-affected Bangarmau town in Unnao the most.More than 12 years ago, their village had hit headlines for reporting a large number of HIV positive cases in a health camp. The incident had lent Udai Sarai a negative image, feel its residents, some of them relieved that the tag is now for Bangarmau’s villages. “Whenever I told people I was from Udai Sarai, they used to quickly check if it was the same HIV village that made news a few years ago. Though I was embarrassed, I had to accept the truth,” said former village head Dhanraj.“The Unnao villages’ incident is unfortunate,” he added, referring to the case where a quack had infected 58 people with a syringe. “But things will change if people determine. Take the case of our village, no new HIV case has been reported in Udai Sarai for a few years. This will help us shun the bad image,” he added.Awareness measures have helped Udai Sarai stay HIV-free for 5 years‘Women spearheading change by discussing prevention’In the detection in 2005, 52 people had tested positive for HIV. Of them, 48 have died while the remaining are on anti-retroviral therapy. The village, barely 18km from a government hospital, was home to around 500 families at that time. At least one member from each was working in Maharashtra or Gujarat. With migrant population believed to be a major reason for the virus, HIV came to be known as ‘Mumbai wali bimari’ here.Today, 90% of the 700 houses in the village have someone working in Maharashtra but no new case has been reported in the past five years.Women have driven the change by openly talking about prevention, claim health activists and officials. Caution has become their second nature.“Women maketheir husbands get themselves tested for HIV at least once a year,” said Vidya Devi, who was a newly wed in 2005. Anganwadi worker Gyan Swaroopa has been a hero of HIV prevention by counselling the women. Breaking barriers of shame and harassment—there is fear of being teased by men for talkingabout sex—she speaks openly to every boy who heads to Mumbai. “Isme kahekisharam... jaan hai to jahan hai (Why be ashamed of doing my duty. Health and survival are the most important),” she reasons.As a result, the air of stigma around HIV is absent in this village.“You can pose direct questions on HIV here unlike in other villages. In fact, HIV testing is considered even at the onset of a simplefever,” saidRajendra Sahu of Nehru Yuva Sangathan Tisi, a social organisation working to create awareness around HIV/ AIDS. Village head Jagatpal said: “The men have been told to have sex only with their wives. The elders keep an eye on the behaviour of their children. Those in Mumbai keep an eye on each other and ensure that no one gets deviated. Medical advice is taken for every disease. Even a simple fever is not ignored and HIV testing is done.”“No HIV positive case has been reported from this village in five years,” said Dr SP Jauhari, secretary of the district aids control society. However, HIV cases in Fatehpur district have continued to rise. Against 97 cases in 2014, 163 cases were reported in 2017. January alone this year has seen 27 cases, data from the health department shows."

The data reveals that prevalence of HIV in this group was higher than in the 15-49 age group.Combined data for Gujarat, Daman and Dadra Nagar Haveli reveals that 0.19% of men in the age group of 15-49 were HIV positive while the number for women in the same age group was 0.18%. The data further reveals that in the age group of 15-54, the number increased to 0.24%.The officials said that in the 15-24 years group, prevalence was more than any other age group. Interestingly, in this age group, no female was found to be HIV positive. The data also reveals that these are the percentage of HIV positive women and men tested by groups of states or Union territories.The data further reveals that of the 0.48% married couples who are HIV positive only 0.04% were couples where both spouses were HIV positive. The data further revealed that 0.22% men were HIV positive with their wives being HIV negative. Similarly, in 0.22% it was the wife who was HIV positive while the husband was not HIV positive.The survey also brought to light the failure of the government to create awareness about HIV. According to the data released, only 69% of men and 43% of women were aware that use of condoms during sex can prevent HIV. Among men, Gujarat ranked 10 from the bottom when it came to knowledge of condoms and women were the fourth worst, better only than Bihar, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Nagaland.The data reveals the awareness of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV/AIDS was very poor in Gujarat among women, Dadra and Nagar Haveli has the lowest awareness (16%) of MTCT, followed by Bihar (33%) and Gujarat (34%).The data further reveals that only 59% women were aware of HIV, while among 77% men had awareness about HIV. The data further reveals that only 1% of women had high-risk intercourse in 2015-16 while 6.8% of men had high-risk intercourse in same period. Also, only 23.6% women and men knew how to prevent HIV/AIDS and another 20% had comprehensive knowledge. Divyang Oza, the project officer of the AIDS Control Society said that teenage groups are the most affected and the most common mode of infection was sexual transmission. The second strongest mode for HIV transmission is blood transfusion. It also cannot be denied that many couples only use condom for family planning and are unaware that it can be used to prevent HIV. Oza further said that HIV awareness has to be increased, but it is a time-consuming process and while there has been an improvement, it is less than expected."

Rajasthan prisons: HIV screening for inmates in Rajasthan prisons to be strengthened,2018-02-20,JAIPUR,"News,City News,Jaipur News","JAIPUR: Inmates of jails across Rajasthan will undergo testing for HIV with the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society ( RSACS ) and Rajasthan Prisons headquarter , Rajasthan signing an MoU for providing HIV prevention and treatment services on Tuesday.Recently in Udaipur’s prison, the health authorities conducted screening of 2119 inmates and 40 of them were tested positive for HIV. Besides, there were more than 15 intravenous drug users.According to the RSCACS officials, national HIV counselling and testing services guidelines by NACO in 2016 state that HIV screening/confirmation should be included as an integral component of the healthcare service package being offered to the inmates living in prison settings.The MoU says, “The spread of HIV among people living in prisons has significant public health implications as almost all of them return to their community thereby facilitating the spread of HIV infection to the general population.”However, state’s director general of prisons Bhupendra Singh said, “We are already providing the healthcare facilities to inmates but we are thinking to re-conceptulise how to organise healthcare services not only for HIV but also for other health related issues including non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension.”He said that there are certain issued such as shortage of guards who accompany an inmate to healthcare facilities for treatment. He said that they are taking up the issue and also making provisions to strengthen the healthcare facilities within the prisons so that the requirement of travel to health centres will be minimised.Speaking on the occasion, additional chief secretary Veenu Gupta said, “Bhilwara, Chitorgarh and Dungarpur are also emerging as high priority districts. The prevalence among migrants and truckers is 2- 3 times higher than that of ANC clinic attendees, adding belief to the hypothesis that migration is playing an important role in Rajasthan.”"

Bera stressed that there is no need to match horoscope before marriage, but blood tests are mandatory to ensure that the bride and groom lead a healthy and happy life in future.On Monday, he married off his daughter. But before that he set an example for others to follow. He made sure that the bride and groom go through a thorough blood test procedure before they tie knot. Not only this, he organised a discussion on the need for blood tests before marriage ahead of the wedding ceremony. He also arranged a blood test camp at the venue. Apart from blood group determination, HIV screening was also done.The invitees also listened to the discussion with rapt attention. Along with the invitation card, pamphlets were also distributed. The only aim of Lakshman Chandra Bera is to educate the masses about the health issues related to blood. His initiative was appreciated by Girish Chandra Bera, the Chief Health Officer of West Midnapore The groom, Rathin Biswas, a professor from Kalyani, had readily agreed to his father-in-law's proposal of a blood test.

New AI system may help check TB spread in India,2018-02-21,LOS ANGELES,News,"LOS ANGELES: Scientists have developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) system that can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis in India more effectively than public outreach campaigns.The algorithm is also optimised to make the most of limited resources, such as advertising budgets.Researchers used behavioural, demographic and epidemic disease data, to create a model of disease spread that captures underlying population dynamics and contact patterns between people.Using computer simulations, they tested the algorithm on two real-world cases: tuberculosis (TB) in India and gonorrhea in the US.In both cases, they found the algorithm did a better job at reducing disease cases than current health outreach policies by sharing information about these diseases with individuals who might be most at risk.""Our study shows that a sophisticated algorithm can substantially reduce disease spread overall,"" said Bryan Wilder , PhD candidate at University of Southern California in the US.""We can make a big difference, and even save lives, just by being a little bit smarter about how we use resources and share health information with the public,"" said Wilder.The algorithm also appeared to make more strategic use of resources. The team found it concentrated heavily on particular groups and did not simply allocate more budget to groups with a high prevalence of the disease.This seems to indicate that the algorithm is leveraging non-obvious patterns and taking advantage of sometimes-subtle interactions between variables that humans may not be able to pinpoint.The model also takes into account that people move, age, and die, reflecting more realistic population dynamics than many existing algorithms for disease control.For instance, people may not be cured instantly, so reducing prevalence at age 30 could mean creating targeted public health communications for people at age 27.""While there are many methods to identify patient populations for health outreach campaigns, not many consider the interaction between changing population patterns and disease dynamics over time,"" said Sze-chuan Suen , assistant professor at USC ""Fewer still consider how to use an algorithmic approach to optimize these policies given the uncertainty of our estimates of these disease dynamics. We take both of these effects into account in our approach,"" said Suen.Since transmission patterns for infection vary with age, the research team used age-stratified data to determine the optimal targeted audience demographic for public health communications.However, the algorithm could also segment populations using other variables, including gender and location.In the future, the study's insights could also shed light on health outcomes for other infectious disease interventions, such as HIV or the flu."

HIV-AIDS awareness laks among UP people: 'Every fourth sexually active person in UP has not heard of HIV-AIDS',2018-02-14,LUCKNOW,"News,City News,Lucknow News,Civic Issues","LUCKNOW: Over 27% men and women in the 15-49 years age group have not even heard about HIV-AIDS. This means that every fourth person in the largely sexually active age group in the state have not heard about.The fact, noted in the recently released fourth National Family Health Survey report , explains why incidents like the one in Unnao can take place in the state. To recall, over 50 persons belonging to a couple of villages in Unnao's Bangarmau area tested positive to HIV infection in a period of seven months.While a quack who reportedly administered injection to locals with the same syringe is being blamed for the havoc, theory of the affected persons contracting the infection as a result of unsafe sexual behaviour is not being ruled out.The report also assessed higher risk sex among men and women of UP. Higher-risk sex refers to sexual intercourse with someone who is neither a spouse nor a cohabiting partner.Among those who had sex in the past 12 months, only 1% women and 9% men reported having higher-risk sex during the period. The trend was higher in urban than rural areas. A small proportion of respondents said that they had multiple sex partners in past one year (0.3% of women and 3% of men).Over one-fourth of men (26%) who had higher-risk sex in the past 12 months reported using a condom the last time they had higher-risk sex. One percent of men said they had paid for sex in the past year. Though the numbers are small, 34% men who paid for sexual intercourse in past one year used a condom the last time they paid for sexual intercourse.The report also showed that only 18% women and 26% men in the state have a comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS. This means that they know that consistent use of condoms during sex and having just one uninfected committed sex partner can reduce the chance of it . But on an overall scale, 52% women and 26% men were not aware of the importance of use of condoms and commitment.Comprehensive knowledge of HIV-AIDS also entails awareness to the fact that a healthy-looking person can have it and they reject common misconceptions about transmission or prevention of HIV-AIDS.

Meerut: Five friends from Meerut set up system to prevent milk wastage on Shivratri; save over 100 litres,2018-02-15,MEERUT,"News,City News,Meerut News","MEERUT: Whenever Karan Goel’s family asked him to accompany them to a Shiva temple on Shivratri , the 24-year-old protested and said he did not like wasting milk on the shivling, which otherwise could feed the poor. The youth discussed the matter with four of his former classmates and friends, and together they devised a system that prevents the milk from being wasted, without hurting anybody’s religious feelings.After making a contraption, the group convinced the priest at Bileshwar Nath temple in Meerut to set up the system in the premises on Shivratri and published pamphlets and distributed them to devotees. On Wednesday, they saved over 100 litres of milk and distributed it to underprivileged and orphaned children.“Nishant Singhal, Anmol Sharma, Ankit Chaudhary, Charchit Kansal and I passed out from Meerut Public School in 2012. Later, some of us moved to different cities for graduation. We had discussed the idea on several occasions and finally decided to execute it on this Shivratri,” Karan said.“Devotees pour milk on the kalash which is placed right above the shivling. We made two holes in the kalash — one on its base and the other one at a certain height. The kalash had a capacity of seven litres. So we devised a system which ensured that after one litre of milk trickled down on the shivling, the remaining six litres flowed into a container through the pipe attached to the second hole,” he saidThe apparatus was set up on a steel tripod stand attached to the shivling. “We spent only Rs 2,500 to develop this system. We will be uploading videos on our Facebook page ‘India Against Hunger’ so that it can be replicated by people in other cities,” said Nishant Singhal, who is pursuing BCA from IIMT College, Meerut.After the initial testing, the group contacted Parag Milk Foods to be doubly sure about the quality of the milk. “We were told that the only way to ensure the milk doesn’t get contaminated is by storing it in steel containers and by appealing to the devotees to pour only plain milk on the kalash. Often, people add flower petals and other things to the milk. Through pamphlets, we request such people to pour milk directly on the shivling and not on the kalsh,” said Anmol Sharma, who is pursuing graduation from Bharat Institute of Technology in Meerut.The apparatus was first tested at Saket Shiva temple on Monday and Tuesday. “We had expected to save 50 litres of milk on Shivratri. However, to our surprise, we ended up saving over 100 litres by afternoon. The saved milk was sent to Satyakaam Manav Seva Samiti which provides shelter to orphaned children and HIV positive kids,” said Charchit Kansal, who is pursuing BSc from Delhi University “We have handed over the apparatus to the temple authorities. Every Monday, a portion of milk offered by the will be sent to underprivileged children,” said Ankit Chaudhary, an engineering student."

government-run schools in Gurgaon: 65% students in Gurugram’s govt schools have exam stress: SCERT survey,2018-02-27,GURUGRAM,"News,Education","GURUGRAM: Exam stress affects around 65% students of government-run schools in Gurgaon , according to the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT), which conducted a state-wide survey on exam stress during November-December 2017. The results of the survey were released on Friday.The survey is part of a bigger survey on adolescents in the state, whose results are expected to be released next month. It consisted of four parts — general information about the children, their families and backgrounds, challenges they face while growing up (which includes exam stress) and their knowledge of HIV, drugs and sexual harassment. SCERT officials said the survey was conducted to know what kids were doing, what they were thinking and learning, and what authorities could do to improve their lives.According to the report, a majority of students in government schools across the state are stressed during examinations. While the percentage of students who are stressed in the entire state is around 61%, 65% of kids surveyed in Gurgaon said they were worried about not performing well in exams. Brahm Prakash, who led the survey, said: “It shows students see exams as a burden. Steps are being taken at the district level to ensure students don’t feel pressure during exams.”Carried out in 119 blocks in Gurgaon, 33,660 students — 14,467 boys and 19,193 girls — were given questionnaires to fill for the survey. Asked if they knew about stress, 72% said ‘yes’, 25% said ‘no’ and 4% gave no response. Around 19% were from urban backgrounds, whereas around 81% hailed from rural areas.Speaking about the survey, SCERT director Jyoti Choudhary said, “There is immense stress among students today. Parents are giving stress to kids. They don’t give them breaks between studies. Gaps in the teaching-learning process are not being filled. Parents only tend to criticise schools, but don’t care if their kids are learning effectively.”To beat stress, most students prefer listening to music. Around 64% of students in Gurgaon listen to music to beat stress, while the number was 65% in Faridabad. Some preferred to do other things to deal with stress — in the entire state, around 55% enjoyed listening to music, 25% read books and 20% preferred to play.Experts said to tackle exam stress, one should study for short intervals with breaks in between. “ Instead of studying overnight before exams, students should have a full night’s rest. A healthy diet with short breaks between studies is also important,” said Shweta Sharma, clinical psychologist, Columbia Asia hospital.Career counsellor Hema Gupta also spoke to TOI about various methods for students to succeed in exams. “Most parents worry their kids won’t score high marks or that their colleagues’ kids will perform better. There is intense competition among students these days. It’s essential parents maintain calm and not add to the kid’s stress. Students should self-assess and solve sample papers before exams.”"
Gorakhpur: 23 inmates in Gorakhpur jail found HIV positive,2018-02-28,GORAKHPUR,"News,City News,Lucknow News,Crime","GORAKHPUR: Twenty-three inmates of Gorakhpur jail have been found to be HIV-positive, said jail administration, the finding coming soon after 58 people were declared HIVpositive in three villages of Unnao district’s Bangarmau tehsil, Uttar Pradesh.Most of the affected inmates are undertrials, the jail administration sources said.The cases were discovered during regular health camps held at the jail over the past several months. Screening was conducted under the supervision of the UP State AIDS Control Society (UPSACS), said Gorakhpur jail superintendent Ramdhani Mishra . “Health camps to examine the health of prisoners are organised from time to time, During the past several months, 23 inmates, including a woman, have tested HIV-positive,” he said. All of them are under treatment at the ART Centre in BRD Medical College. They get all their medicine and other medical help from the centre, he added. Mishra , however, couldn’t elaborate on the reason for the infection. “It is very difficult for us to know the source of infection. We can only say that they have been found HIV-positive during checkups.” According to prison department officials, 1,400 inmates of Gorakhpur jail have already been screened and 400 more are being examined.‘We hold health camps for awareness’IG (prisons) Pramod Kumar Mishra said an exercise to identify such patients was on across all UP prisons and a report on the findings would be forwarded to the state government. “We organise health camps for better awareness among these patients,” he said.Last month, Unnao’s Bangarmau tehsil hit the headlines when 58 residents of three villages tested HIV-positive at health camps organised locally in November and January. It was alleged that the infection had been caused by a quack who reportedly used infected syringes. The development triggered the health department into action while NACO and UPSACS officials rushed to the affected localities for awareness camps."
HC upholds life term for man who killed toddler son,2018-03-05,Bengaluru,"News,City News,Bengaluru News","Bengaluru: The Karnataka high court has upheld the life sentence awarded to a man who killed his 16-month-old son by feeding him water laced with anti-retroviral (HIV) drugs, suspecting he wasn’t his biological father.A division bench of justices Ravi Malimath and K Somashekar affirmed the September 27, 2012 verdict of a fast-track court holding Ravi alias Battery Ravi guilty of killing his son.“There may be some discrepancies in the evidence of some witnesses who had been treated as hostile, but that of the prosecution witnesses, the mother, a child witness, the investigating officer, the panch witnesses, the doctor who conducted autopsy and a retired doctor is clinching and proves the guilt of the accused,” the bench observed in its order.The trial court had said Ravi, a resident of Saraswathipuram colony, Hunsur in Mysuru district, shouldn’t be released for the rest of his life.According to the prosecution, around 10am on June 16, 2011, Ravi took his second child, Nishor, from the maternal house of his wife on the pretext of buying him some eatables. It is said that he took Nishor (along with his sister-in-law’s son) to an under-construction Maratha community hall near Shanimahathma temple in Hunsur town. Suspecting that Nishor was not born to him, he made the child drink water mixed with powdered anti-retroviral tablets like Zidovudine, Lamivudine and Nevirapine.Nishor was frothing when Ravi brought him back to his wife and was immediately rushed to government hospital in Hunsur and later taken to KR Hospital, Msyuru, where he died.The wife testified that when she was pregnant with her second child, Ravi abandoned her after getting to know that she had a hole in her heart, forcing her to live with her parents. She further said Ravi told her family that she should be sent back only when she recovers and didn’t take her to his house even when there was a reconciliation.The son of Ravi’s sister-in-law, an eyewitness, testified that his uncle took him along with Nishor to a bakery, bought them eatables and juice and then took them to the Maratha community hall where he made Nishor drink water laced with powdered tablets in a steel glass.The investigating officer testified that Ravi alone could have got those anti-retroviral drugs which are prescribed for a person with HIV as the accused in his voluntary statement said his parents were taking the drugs regularly. The doctor testified that he was treating Ravi’s father (now dead), an HIV positive patient, and had prescribed the tablets to him."
HIV: An HIV-positive dream hits house hurdle in Kolkata,2018-03-05,KOLKATA,"News,City News,Kolkata News,Civic Issues","KOLKATA: They are a bunch of 10 ordinary teenagers, who nourish the dream of making it big. But their HIV-positive status has turned them into social pariahs, with the city offering them no space to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams.Out to open their own café called “Cafe Positive”, all they have met with for the last three months is a big negative. No house-owner in some of south Kolkata’s posh localities has been willing to rent out space once told about “who will manage and run the shop”.While a few landlords have straightaway refused saying “e paray erom cholbena (such business won’t run in this neighbourhood)”, others have been courteous enough with financial help and old clothes, but pleaded helplessness in renting out space to the 18-plus teens.The NGO funding the café and trying to find a 750sqft space has approached over a dozen owners since December at locations like Golpark, Dover Lane, Lake Road , Hindustan Park and Purna Das Road. “We have been looking for a suitable space for the café since December and approached a number of house-owners directly and through brokers. The owners initially seemed excited at the concept, but the moment they learnt that the shop will be managed and run solely by HIV-positive children, they backed out,” said Kallol Ghosh , founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for abandoned HIV/AIDS-infected children.TOI spoke to two house-owners, one at Lake Road and the other at Dover Lane. “I would not mind renting out space to them. But we live in a joint family and some members have objections. I could not convince them, so I rejected the offer,” said a landlady.The house-owner at Dover Lane, too, blamed her neighbours and family. “I don’t know how people in our neighbourhood would react to it. I know there are many misconceptions associated with HIV . I don’t think I am in a position to convince everyone. Moreover, I have now decided to rent the space to a boutique and not an eatery,” he said.The Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2017 defines what can count as discrimination against HIV-positive people. It lists that denial or discontinuation of employment, education, healthcare services, renting or residing property, standing for public or private office will count as discrimination along with unfair treatment in any of the above mentioned categories.The shelter at Narendrapur is home to around 70-odd young patients and this café project is part of an initiative to make a group self-sufficient. The NGO will give the initial funds and later hand over the management of the café to the 10 boys and girls, who would be running it.“We have been undergoing training at this shelter and can’t wait to start our café. We know the disease we suffer from and how it spreads or what precautions we need to take. But strangely, the adults don’t understand that HIV doesn’t spread through touch and often hesitate to even shake hands with us,” said Susanta Pal (name changed), a Class XII student who was diagnosed with HIV when he was just 5.“HIV does not spread by kissing, hugging, sharing food/drink, toilet seats, sweat, touching, sneeze/cough or through insect bites. We also want society to know about these from our café. But for that, we first need an opportunity,” said Sathi Biswas (name changed), another Class XII student who specialises in sandwich-making and baking cookies.According to the plan, food and beverages at the 750sqft ground-floor café will be served on disposable plates and there will be no sharp cutleries or glass items that can cause bleeding. “We are not looking for any exceptions or rebate and are ready to pay as per the existing market rate but even then not a single house-owner is ready,” lamented Ghosh."

"Sexually Transmitted Infection: After 10 years, old sexually-transmitted infection makes comeback in Chennai",2018-03-05,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Civic Issues","CHENNAI: Syphilis — once considered the scourge of rulers, artists and military servicemen — is re-emerging. And cases are being picked up by an unlikely source: neighbourhood eye doctors. After a decade-long lull, ophthalmologists say they are seeing a resurgence of syphilis in the eye, an ocular manifestation of the sexually transmitted infection . In its advanced stage, it could render a person blind.The first time 45-year-old Sridhar* consulted doctors at Sankara Nethralya in Chennai with prolonged rednessin his right eye, they suspected conjunctivitis. Two weeks later, he returned. This time, he complained his vision was blurry.“On a hunch we took a sample from his eye and referred him to a venereologist,” said Dr Pathopratim Majumder , consultant ophthalmologist at the hospital. He tested positive for the sexually transmitted infection.Dr Majumder said although ocular syphilis is not a new phenomenon, recent resurgence in the incidence of overall syphilis, particularly among HIV-positive individuals, has sparked a new interest in an old disease. “The infection is still rare. But as many doctors are still unaware that syphilis is back, they don’t actively lookfor it,” said the doctor, whose paper reviewing the clinical presentation and diagnosis of ocular syphilis was published recently in peer-reviewed scientific journal Ocular Immunology and Inflammation.Syphilis, caused by bacterium Treponema pallidum, usually surfaces in the body as firm painless sores. If left untreated, the sores, doctors say, usually go away within three to six weeks. The bacterium, however, stays in the body and can progress to cause rashes, sore throat, and headache.It can also affect the central nervoussystem and induce swelling of the protective membrane covering the brain and the uvea – the vascular middle layer of the eye.Though neurological and ocular manifestations are often thought of as symptoms of late syphilis, in the recent cases picked up by ophthalmologists vision problems appear to be an early symptom.“Some of these patients had no other definitive symptoms,” said Dr Amar Agarwal , chairman, Dr Agarwal’s Eye hospital. Ocular syphilis presents as blurry vision, light sensitivity, double vision, eye pain and foreign body sensation.Dr Agarwal said doctors are also picking up symptoms of other STDs including AIDS based on infections in the eyes .“In some instances, the patient is aware of the HIV statusbut comestousfor help as eye infections are often overlooked in regular STD/ STI tests. Ophthalmologists, on the other hand, still haven’t started linking the two, as syphilis has been away for a long time,” said the doctor."
HIV-positive youths: Help starts pouring in for HIV-positive youths,2018-03-06,KOLKATA,"News,City News,Kolkata News","KOLKATA: At least three house owners in the city offered to rent out portions of their houses and several others offered donation to 10 HIV-positive teenagers — in pursuit of their entrepreneurial dream — on Monday, a day after TOI reported how scores of property owners refused to offer a space on rent to them to run a café once they learnt about their physical condition.“I have been receiving calls and emails since morning from several Good Samaritans in the city who are willing to offer space. After months of rejection, this feels like a whiff of fresh air and finally, it feels like the youths can dream big. We have lined up appointments to see the spaces over this week and hopefully, we can finalise a place by the end of this month,” said Kallol Ghosh , the founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for the HIV-positive youths at Narendrapur.TOI had reported on Monday that the group of 6 young boys and 4 girls have undergone training in baking, sandwich-making and coffee and mocktail-making and aspired to start their own coffee shop named ‘Café Positive’. However, months of making rounds of several properties in some of the prominent locations in south Kolkata — like Lake Road, Dover Lane, Hindusthan Park, Gol Park and Ballygunge — yielded no result. The moment the house owners came to know about the medical condition of the youths, they started distancing them from the project and refused to offer the space on rent citing “problems to be caused by the neighbourhood and family”.“Everywhere, we were turned down and at one point of time, we felt like our dream can never come true. But then, things started to change from Monday morning. Our teachers at the Home have said several people are calling us up to offer space on rent. This news itself is special for us,” said Sathi Biswas (name changed), a Class XII student who specialises in sandwich-making and baking cookies.As per the plan, the youths want to set up a café on a 750 square feet ground floor space. The food and beverages will be served on disposable plates and there would be no sharp cutleries or glass items that can cause bleeding or cut injuries. “There will be a corner in the café where people can even make their own coffee. We will also have a space where people can make their own food items and sell it from our outlet by paying us a portion of the sales. There will also be regular gigs and space for budding musicians in the city. And of course, there will be posters and tent cards, making people aware of the disease and the myths surrounding it,” said Sanmit Das (name changed), another Class XII student.Among the many who have offered space to them is a woman from Salt Lake and two from south and north Kolkata. “The lady from Salt Lake has asked us to go immediately and see her space.

Puppeteers with strings attached,2018-03-07,"In November last year, puppeteer Subhasis Neogi was giving finishing touches to a 6-foot-tall cigarette dummy and a 7-foot-tall crab for public awareness campaigns against smoking and cancer.

But little did he know that his life would take a 360-degree turn in 2002 after attending a workshop of Dadi Pudumjee, a Sangeet Natak Akademi Award-winning puppeteer, in the city. “Meeting him changed my life forever,” Neogi recalls. “I was amazed by the menagerie of puppets”. Even though well aware that puppetry was a dying art, this Bengali babu in his mid-40s didn’t think twice before quitting his humble job to control the movements of the marionettes.In this struggle to keep the art alive, Neogi is joined by city puppeteers such as Sunil Bhatt, who all agree that the International Puppet Festival held recently at Tagore Theatre has given this ancient art form a much-needed impetus for revival. Tagore Theatre director Kuldeep Sharma said: “This was the sixth edition of the festival. Over the years, the excitement among the youngsters for participating in this festival has increased manifold.” Both Sunil and Neogi meet at puppet festivals and discuss how they can promote their art and develop it further. While Neogi has three-to-five members in his team, Sunil is a oneman troupe.Kaimbwala villager Sunil recalls that the influence of his father, Badri, was the reason he developed an interest in the magical world of wooden dolls attached with strings. His father worked mainly with traditional kathputli, which Sunil knew was a dying art in an age when children are exposed to varied and more attractive sources of entertainment. Sunil blends modern and traditional techniques for his show, in which he tells children stories through puppets and muppets to keep them engaged. “I find a lot of happiness in performing in front of kids,” says Sunil, who has been in his profession for eight years.Neogi and his wife, Anupama , formed a group, Putul Nacher Ashor ( PNA ), in 2005. It’s a kind of theatre that uses dummies (read puppets), besides actors. He made his debut at Banga Bhawan in 2003 with a Bengali puppet show based on the theme of ‘harmful effects of polythene’. The next year, he did a show in Hindi based on the theme of sound. Today, Neogi conducts workshops in schools across Tricity and participates in puppet festivals across the country. He has also done a puppet show with the teachers of Gurgaon. It was titled ‘Maa Tujhe Salaam’. “I work with giant puppets, creating which costs me a lot of money. It’s difficult to survive but my passion has kept me alive,” Neogi said with a twinkle in his eye.Neogi had worked in Kolkata theatre before coming to Chandigarh, so it didn’t take him long to understand that Chandigarh isn’t as receptive to new cultural ideas as metro cities and he might not get a captive audience every time to watch his puppets dance on the stage with the help of strings. So, he started doing social awareness campaigns using puppetry. Doctors from the radiotherapy department of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) supported him wholeheartedly.One of Neogi’s best creations—a giant crab—was for National Cancer Awareness Day. He also designed and created many other giant puppets to spread awareness about thalassemia and hand hygiene. He is part of the regular awareness drives of State AIDS Control Society. For the past 20 years, he also conducts theatre-ineducation programmes in the local government schools. Vivek High School in Sector 38 has started a new puppet theatre activity under his professional guidance.Sunil also conducts puppet workshops in various schools across Tricity. From ‘Beti bachao, beti padhao’ to ‘Say no to drugs’, he has been part of many awareness campaigns, including those about HIV, AIDS, and several social causes. “I also do summer workshop in schools, where I teach children to make puppets out of socks and strings, and use them in a show,” said Sunil, who considers Sangeet Natak Akademi Awardwinning puppeteer Puran Bhatt his mentor.Neogi is clear in his head that “I will never sell my art to perform at birthdays”. He is content doing school workshops. However, Sunil, because of different circumstances, doesn’t mind doing glove-and-string puppetry at birthday parties and weddings. “These days, children adore animated characters Doraemon and Chhota Bheem. I have a series of skits based on these puppets and I can deliver whatever the client asks me to,” said Sunil. Economic hardship forces him to sign up for these shows. “I had a house in Chandigarh that I had to sell after my mother fell sick. My family has moved into a rented accommodation and I must support it,” he said."
Get voluntary donor for blood transfusion to cut infection risk,2018-03-08,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Delhi News","NEW DELHI: If you need blood transfusion, it’s better to get a voluntary donor than depend entirely on hospital stock. That’s because blood collected through replacement donations have a high rate of infection A retrospective study conducted at Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital, which is the regional blood transfusion centre for east Delhi, has confirmed it. Data published in the latest issue of Indian Journal of Medical Research shows the centre received 2.2 lakh units of blood in six years, from January 2008 to December 2014.Nearly 75% of the blood was collected through voluntary donations (VD) while the rest of it was through replacement donations (RD). Simply put, RD refers to blood donated by a relative or friend in lieu of blood transfused to a patient from the hospital stock.When these blood samples were tested for infections, doctors found transfusion-transmitted infection rates very high in case of RD as compared to VD — a concern raised by many experts in the past.In 2014, for example, 81 units of blood collected at GTB Hospital tested positive for HIV. Of these, 76 were RDs. Prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis and malaria was also found to be four to five times higher in case of RD as compared to VD (see graphic).“Patients often arrange for professional donors if they cannot find someone from among family and friends. They conceal medical history, which makes it difficult to rule out infection,” said a doctor.GTB doctors have stressed on the need to increase public awareness about VD and its benefits. Also, they have called for meticulous donor screening and use of highly sensitive techniques for detection of transfusion-transmitted infections to prevent the spread of diseases.National Blood Bank Policy 2002 also calls for phasing out of RDs. But an RTI reply accessed by TOI showed the practice of seeking RDs was prevalent across the country. It also revealed that Delhi hospitals collected nearly a million units as RDs in five years from 2012-13 to 2016-17, which is the third highest across all states.At 20.15 lakh, Uttar Pradesh had the highest rate of blood collection through RD, followed by Karnataka (9.88 lakh).Dr Vijay Kumar from the geriatric division of AIIMS said hospitals seek RDs because there is a scarcity of VDs and hospitals have to maintain their stocks.“There is an urgent need for a registry of VDs and giving them incentives. We must do away with this practice of RDs because it is fraught with risks and causes avoidable stress to a patient’s family,” Kumar said.Delhi has 69 blood banks of which 34 are run by private hospitals, 11 by Delhi government hospitals, nine by central government hospitals, eight by voluntary organisations and three by municipal corporations. There are four private blood banks.Dr Bharat Singh, who heads Delhi State Blood Transfusion Cell, said RDs are higher in private hospitals as compared to government hospitals and blood banks. “DSBTC can only recommend or suggest hospitals to seek more blood through donation . We do not have staff or infrastructure to organise camps for VD,” he said. Singh is one of the authors of the study."
HIV woman: International Women's Day 2018: HIV+ woman who’s spreading positivity,2018-03-08,SURAT,"News,City News,Surat News","SURAT: Her life had many twists and turns as she had to pass from the toughest struggle for inclusion and acceptance after facing discrimination in society when she was detected with HIV in 1997.At the age of 21 years, she and her husband had to take a tough decision to abort the child. With a mission to change peoples’ perception about HIV/AIDS, she got herself involved in social activities for HIV community. At present, she is the face of HIV community in the country.Meet Daxa Patel , who is not only president of National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India (NCPI+), but also relentlessly working for patients, most of them outcast by the society. From organizing awareness camps to marriage fairs for HIV patients and successfully running a day-boarding school and hostel for HIV-infected children, Daxa has put her life, blood and sweat for their uplift.“When my husband and I were diagnosed with HIV in 1997, there was no treatment available. Meanwhile, I got pregnant and had no choice but to go for termination. One of the doctors told me that my lifespan was just for five months. I was searching for a person infected with HIV and I found a woman who was living with the disease for two years. This gave me confidence that I could also live long. This was the turning point in my life,” says 42-year-old Daxa.Daxa, who was doing a small embroidery business from her house, and her husband informed their family and relatives about the disease. To their surprise, the family was very supportive and this further boosted her confidence on fighting discrimination faced by people like her. Her treatment began only in 2007, 10 years after he was infected.It was in 2003, Daxa, who was earlier working as a counsellor with a city-based non-governmental organization SAHAS, got in touch with Umesh Patel. Along with Umesh and other few community members, they decided to launch a platform for HIV positive people. This is how the Gujarat State Network for People Living with HIV/ÁID (GSNP+) was launched in 2003.The main objective of GSNP+ was to assist the people infected with HIV/AIDS, ensure they get proper medical attention and timely medicines and organizing awareness programmes etc.“We used to meet the HIV patients at some deserted places and gardens to protect their identity. We started with just 35 members at GSNP+ and now we have 67,000 members across all the districts in Gujarat,” she said.Later, the NCPI+ was launched at the national level and the organization has a presence in 32 states across the country. Daxa is also running Janani Dham for the destitute HIV and AIDS infected orphaned children on the outskirts of the city since 2009. It is supported by Gujarat government’s social justice department and Surat-based P P Savani Group and has around 98 boys and girls.GSNP+ will soon launch a scheme for HIV positive people, where they can get easy medicine refill and won’t have to visit government dispensaries. This is for the first time that a project has been launched with the state government and will be introduced on national-level."
HIV positive woman: International Women's Day 2018: Social evils and stigma cannot crush her courage,2018-03-08,AHMEDABAD,"News,City News,Ahmedabad News,Civic Issues","AHMEDABAD: She was forced to marry at the age of 17. She had to marry twice in marriage barter and when she was diagnosed HIV-positive, her husband left her to the mercy of the society. She did not even separate legally from her husband fearing that her brother’s life will be ruined according to barter wedding practice. But she has finally emerged triumphant against all social evils and stigmas and now she has been counselling HIV-positive persons to earn her and her son’s livelihood.Asha (name changed),35, is an HIV-positive woman who counsels HIV-positive patients in a village of Banaskantha district to earn the livelihood for herself and her 10-year-old son, and also to forget the plight of the social evils and stigmas.In 2000, Asha, then 17, was forced to marry a man and according to wedding barter system , her brother was married to her husband's sister. But five years later, her husband eloped with some other girl leaving behind Asha with five months pregnancy. Her community and family members had then decided that her brother will also have to leave his wife. It was even decided that she will have to abort. During the abortion, her condition became critical and then HIV infected blood was transfused to her, said Asha.“In 2007, my community had compelled us into the second barter wedding. Later on, I was diagnosed as HIV-positive when I delivered my first child in 2008. After coming to know this, my husband left me and my newborn kid,” Asha said.She added, “I had lived in front of my husband’s house for two years. But when our community members learnt about it, they held a gathering to decide my fate. I had to hold a feast and arrange their stay by paying a hefty amount, but finally they gave the diktat that I should leave separately from my husband,” Asha says.Asha further said, “Had I taken a legal divorce, then my brother would also have to separate from his wife. So I decided to live separately and started working for HIV-positive persons since 2010.”“When I was diagnosed as HIV-positive, I used to think my life has been reduced. But when I started working for HIV positive persons, I felt the urge to live again and defeat the social stigma,” said Asha."
Narcotics Control Bureau: Nigerian citizen held with heroin worth Rs 6 crore from Rajdhani Express,2018-03-08,VADODARA,"News,City News,Vadodara News","VADODARA: In one of the biggest hauls of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in recent times, a Nigerian citizen was nabbed with 1.2 kg heroin worth Rs six crore from Mumbai-bound Rajdhani Express at Vadodara railway station on Wednesday.Mamdubueze Nonso Charles (38), who was travelling in A5 coach of the train, was arrested around 3.30 am from the train by the Ahmedabad zone sleuths who had a specific information about him from the Delhi zonal unit.“When we searched his luggage, we found three concealed food packets of pistachios and rice flour. On opening them, we found white powder and tests confirmed that it was heroin,” said Hari Om Gandhi, director of Ahmedabad zonal unit of NCB.He added that Charles, who is living in Mumbai for four as a clothes trader, is only a carrier while the sender is the drug dealers. “During interrogation, he told us that he had received the consignment from another Nigerian. However, he has not revealed the name of the person,” said Gandhi.“Charles was told that on reaching Mumbai he would get a call from a specific phone number. He had to tell his location to the caller,” said Gandhi.NCB officials suspect that the receiver would also be a drug dealer as no consumer of heroin would buy the drug in such a large quantity. “Often those addicted to heroin, buy around 50 grams since it is a costly drug,” Gandhi said.NCB will now be investigating about the frequency of Charles’s travels between New Delhi and Mumbai since he has admitted to carrying drugs consignment in the past as well. Though Charles had been living in Mumbai since four years on a business visa, he used to travel between Nigeria and India frequently. Whether he used to carry drugs during his trips between the two countries has not been known. On checking his passport, NCB officials also learnt that his visa had expired on February 28.In June last year, another Nigerian citizen Peter Chinedu Okafor was nabbed from the same Rajdhani Express train with a drugs consignment worth Rs 3.5 crore. Okafor was carrying 255 grams of cocaine, 843 grams of amphetamine and 65 grams of ecstasy tablets. He had admitted of receiving US$ 150 for carrying the drugs.Heroin of Afghan originNCB suspects that the heroin seized from Mamdubueze Nonso Charles is of Afghan origin. According to NCB officials, the heroin which is usually found in India is little brown in colour while the one seized was white, which is found only in Afghanistan. Lately, smuggling of drugs from Afghanistan through Pakistan has increased, officials said.Nigerian claims to be HIV infectedDuring interrogation, Mamdubueze Nonso Charles told investigators is HIV infected. However, NCB will conduct medical tests to confirm this. “He must be saying that he is HIV infected so that we go soft on him or for gaining sympathy from us. But we will make him undergo a medical test to know the truth,” said NCB official."

"Leena Menghaney: ‘Punjab is targeting Hepatitis C, but must include Hepatitis B’",2018-03-08,"The Punjab government has expanded its focus on treatment of Hepatitis C (HCV) since 2016 to include prevention as well.

The initiative was undertaken by Kunal Jadhav , secretary of District Legal Service Authority, with an aim to include the transgender community into the mainstream.Coming from a middle class background, Kamble, a std XII dropout, had to part ways with her family due to her sexual orientation at the age of 17. Facing various ordeals, Kamble was later introduced to the transgender society and Sarthi Trust, which she claims as her home now.Currently working as a counsellor and pre-educator at Sarthi Trust, Kamble said mediation is one of her strong features. “My family abandoned me, but I found a new family which is not judgmental. It is one of the primary reasons why I sit on this esteemed chair today. Every day, I meet individuals who are troubled and understanding their issues and helping them get out of it is my main job. Hence, I am able to work for reconciliation between parties and solve their matters.”As part of the pre-discussion talks, Kamble handles issues related to Motor Acts Claim Tribunal and mediates around 3-4 cases every day. On being questioned about her mediation, she said, “We try to bring out a compromise between the parties and help them understand the legal aspect of the entire proceedings.”Jadhav told TOI, “The initiative is an act of acceptance of the transgenders within the general public. The entire crux of the legal system is to be fair and provide equal opportunities to all and we are doing the same. We wanted to provide a platform to the neglected communities to help the society and Kamble passed all the eligibility criteria with flying colours.”Kamble’s co-panel members VS Murkute, retired district judge, and lawyer Rohini Deshpande , too expressed their happiness over the step. Murkute said such opportunities promote inclusion of the community in the conventional society and sensitizes the public regarding the issue. Deshpande said the measure will act as a morale boost for the transgenders and other communities.Jadhav added that DLSA will include more transgenders as panel members on the day of Lok Adalat and attempts are on to include HIV+ social workers and others as well."
"Naco mandates viral load test for HIV patients, says it will check mortality",2018-02-06,BENGALURU,"News,City News,Bengaluru News","BENGALURU: In what could be a game changer in treating HIV patients, the National AIDS Control Organization (Naco) has decided that all patients registered for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) will undergo viral load testing. It will measure the quantity of HIV virus in patients and help doctors decide their treatment regime.Hitherto, the test was conducted only after the first line of drugs failed, which would happen after 5-7 years of patients being diagnosed with HIV, and result in them losing golden time in starting new medicines.On Saturday, Naco instructed all state governments to get patients to undergo routine viral load tests and check mortality rate. A staggering 80,173 people have died of HIV over the past decade in Karnataka, according to the death audit conducted by Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS).A total of 3.1 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) have registered for ART in the state. Across the country, an estimated 21 lakh HIV positive patients are registered with 525 ART centres. Bengaluru has seven such centres.While 3,16,252 people living with HIV have registered for ART treatment in Karnataka as on December 2017, only 1, 65,917 of them actively turn up for follow-ups. The rest are either dead or don’t visit the centres.The practice till date was to get a patient, whose blood tests positive for HIV, to undergo a CD4 count before starting anti-retro viral drugs. CD4 count is a prognostic indicator where a higher number indicates a stronger immune system. Henceforth, the patient will have to undergo a viral load test too while registering for ART treatment.“The cost of viral load test in the private sector ranges from Rs 4,000-6,000 and not all can afford it. The government will be spending Rs 1,200 per test,” said an officer from KSAPS.This Naco move will be implemented from February 8 through M/s Metropolis Healthcare Limited under a public-private partnership ( PPP ) project. In the first year, the agency will conduct 2.1 lakh tests. The remaining patients will be covered in a phased manner.“Currently, the programme was using targeted viral load testing to confirm suspected treatment failure owing to clinical or immunological failure of the patient. From now on, patients on ART will be monitored via viral load test at regular intervals. The result will allow early detection of potential treatment failure,” a senior officer in KSAPS said.Naco had also set a timeline to be followed while conducting viral load testing. “For patients on the first line of treatment, the test should be done twice in the first year, once every six months. From the second year onwards, it should happen once a year. For second/third line patients, it must be conducted once every six months after the patient’s initiation on ART,” said KSAPS officers.However, NGOs closely working with people living with HIV (PHIV) in creating awareness have questioned the government’s partnership with a private entity. “There is a HIV law in place and the rules are likely to be framed by April 2018. Even before formulating the rules, why has the government tied up with a private party? Besides, if the private agency conducts tests only on 2.1 lakh of the total 21 lakh people registered for ART treatment in the country, it will cover only 10%. What about the rest? Instead, viral load tests should have been mandated for all HIV patients once every six months,” said David Bodapatti, who has been working with PLHIV.HIV positive people on active ART careAdult males: 69,376Adult females: 84,409Transgenders, Transsexuals: 373Male children: 6,443Female children: 5,316Total: 1,65,917Source: KSAPS (figures as on Dec 2017)"
Rs 500 a month for TB patients in Gurugram,2018-02-07,GURUGRAM,"News,City News,Gurgaon News","GURUGRAM: The general budget brought respite to patients of Tuberculosis in the district. The patients will be given Rs 500 a month during the course of their treatment. This is to encourage more people to visit dose centres regularly and for a successful implementation of Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP).The amount of Rs 500 will be given by the health department to the patients. Around Rs 12.50 lakhs will be distributed in the district as per the budget.This will benefit the patients who are undergoing the treatment at the district dose centre. In 2017, around 2061 patients of TB were diagnosed in Gurugram. These include 10 HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) positive ones who are undergoing treatment at the hospital under 99 Dots scheme . The health workers personally administer the fixed dose combination to the co-infected patients by visiting their homes. Each medicine blister has a 10 digit mobile number and the patient has to give a missed call from his registered mobile number to the number from the blister.Dr Vijay Kumar, district tuberculosis officer said “this scheme will directly benefit the patient because it will assist them financially. The amount will be deposited to the benefactor’s bank account under the direct benefit scheme”.Under the RNTCP, patients of tuberculosis have to take their medicines everyday. This is to avoid any relapse of the disease. Earlier, the patients were prescribed a dose on the alternate days.Under the new program, the patient is given only one tablet a day, and the tests will be repeated after 2 months and again after 1 month. However, in case of over-weight patients, the number of pills of the same medicine can be increased."

While doctors boycotted elective and out-patient duties the services were not hit as they took turns to protest.However, members of the Junior Doctors Association (JUDA -Gandhi unit) have decided to intensify the strike from Wednesday, in case they fail to get a response from the superintendent, Dr P Sravan Kumar. They said they will also knock on the doors of higher authorities, including the Director of Medical Education (DME) and the state health minister.The doctors launched the strike on Monday, after they were questioned by the superintendent in the case involving two private lab technicians who were nabbed for carrying blood samples out of the hospital’s maternity ward. While the two were later handed over to the police Sravan Kumar also interrogated doctors, which did not go down well with them.The protesting doctors are now demanding that the superintendent tender an apology for falsely accusing them of being hand in glove with private laboratories and deriving benefits out of such practices. This apart, JUDA members are also demanding an upgrade of basic facilities.“Our basic demand is that provision for basic facilities in emergency be made. Currently when we have an emergency case and we need to attend within an hour, basic investigations like HIV, HBV for viral screening of diseases transmitted through blood, haemoglobin test, platelets, serum, RBC and Blood urea creatine are required to be done immediately. Although we have top-end equipment at the hospital, there isn’t enough manpower to do these tests. Under such circumstances the superintendent is blaming us of being hand in glove with private laboratories for benefits,” said Dr Guguloth Sanjeev, president, JUDA, Gandhi unit.Meanwhile, the hospital superintendent has denied making any allegations against the doctors."

"After blood transfusion at government hospital, 6-year-old tests HIV+",2018-01-13,DEHRADUN,"News,City News,Dehradun News","DEHRADUN: A six-year-old boy from Kaithal district in Haryana who underwent several blood transfusions to treat thalassemia in government hospitals in two states has tested positive for the HIV virus. The family found out about their child contracting HIV earlier this month after blood tests at Civil Hospital, Roorkee, where he was being treated for the blood disorder since August 2017, revealed the infection. Since then, the aggrieved family has been running from pillar to post, trying to find out details of the blood samples that were used for transfusion.Both parents have tested negative for the virus, which the family said confirmed their fears that the boy had most likely been administered HIV-infected blood. The last blood transfusion the patient underwent was at the Roorkee hospital on January 2. The hospital has declined to provide the family details of blood units used for transfusion citing National Aids Control Organization (NACO) guidelines on protecting identity of donors.The uncle of the boy provided TOI with a copy of the letter which the family wrote to the chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the hospital on January 10. The letter read: “Our child was transfused blood on August 28, September 9, October 7, November 17, November 29 and January 2 at your hospital. In the recent blood test it has come out that he is suffering from HIV infection. Please provide us details of blood donors (sic).”The uncle said, “We are shocked at the non-cooperation of hospital staff. They have just handed us a sheet of paper which states that the blood units used in the transfusion were infection-free. What use is it? We want those responsible for ruining the life of a child to be punished and to ensure that no other innocent lives are destroyed.”Dr Arvind K Mishra, CMS, Civil Hospital, Roorkee, maintained that the blood units used for transfusion were “absolutely safe”. “Our staff has verified that the blood used for transfusion was infection-free. The family was refused details of blood units as we cannot share details of blood donors according to NACO guidelines,” Mishra said.A health department official, however, said that the hospital was asked to share details of blood samples with the family. Pradeep Hatwal , assistant director, Uttarakhand State AIDS Control Society, said, “We spoke to the hospital authorities on Thursday and had asked them to provide details of the blood unit such as the lot number, etc, after withholding the name of donors.”Meanwhile, the CMS of the Roorkee hospital has also hinted that the child may have contracted the infection in Kaithal where he underwent over 40 blood transfusions in hospitals before the family moved to Roorkee. The boy’s father works in a private transport firm in Roorkee and his wife and child shifted to the city in August 2017.The traumatized family said that they would now approach Civil Hospital, Kaithal, to seek details of the blood used during transfusions.TOI spoke to principal medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, Kaithal, Dr Mukesh Kumar, who said that the hospital was willing to share details of the blood used during the procedure.“Our hospital tests all donated samples. There is no question of transfusing infected blood to anyone. We will certainly provide the family with details of blood transfused to the child,” Kumar said.The family of the patient said that their circumstances had forced them to shift to their village in Kaithal where nobody was aware that the child was HIV-infected.“The boy will have to live with the stigma of being an HIV patient if we stay in Roorkee as the local residents know of our situation. We have no other option but to go back to our village,” the uncle said."
"Abusive cops push transsexuals into high-risk sexual acts, reveals study",2018-01-14,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Crime","CHENNAI: Physical and verbal harassment by policemen don't just psychologically scar transsexuals (transwomen) but also push them to engage in high-risk sexual behaviour that makes them vulnerable to contracting AIDS, interviews with 300 members of the group have revealed.Researchers from three institutes teamed up to trace the pattern of victimisation among such transsexuals in four states, including Tamil Nadu, and studied its impact on their sexual behaviour.Interviews revealed that in many instances the policemen themselves were their sexual partners and forced them to engage in sex without condoms. In some cases, the implications of the abuse were psychological.The survey by US-based Yale School of Public Health, Postgraduate Insitute of Medical Education and Researcher (PGIMER), Chandigarh, and Centre for Sexuality and Health Research Policy (C-SHaRP), Chennai, was published recently in Violence and Gender - a peer-reviewed journal focusing on understanding, prediction and prevention of violence.Dr Venkatesan Chakrapani of C-SHaRP, a co-author, said, ""We asked them questions like how often they had been verbally harassed by police for being a transgender. They were then asked to respond on a scale ranging from 'never' to 'many times',"" he explained.Close to 43% of the participants reported abuse by police that was either verbal, physical or sexual, or all of them. The average age of the those studied was around 30 years.Around 30% of those victimised by police reported inconsistent condom use with male paying partners compared to the 11% who reported the same in the low victimisation group. Dr Chakrapani said, while some of them reported being raped by policemen, many engaged in sex work said the men in khaki often extorted money. ""This affects their negotiation powers with their clients. When offered more money for sex without condoms, they give in,"" he said.Victimisation can also lead to feelings of low self-esteem, which can impact the negotiation and adoption of safer sex practices. ""The impact is more when the perpetrators are in positions of power,"" said Dr Chakrapani. Participants said police use the law as a means to inflict violence and obtain free sexual services. "" Transsexual sex workers may be more vulnerable to police victimisation due to policies that criminalise transactional sex. These points are particularly salient for those who have sex with men as they can be punished under section 377 of the Indian Penal Code,"" the study noted.In India, the HIV prevalence among transwomen is 7.5%, nearly 19 times higher than the general population and three times more than woemn sex workers. According to the 2011 census, TN has 22,364 transsexuals. The findings, researchers said, will have important implications for sexual risk reduction interventions"
Roorkee: Roorkee boy’s tech start-up adjudged ‘most unique small business in US’,2018-01-15,DEHRADUN,"News,City News,Dehradun News","DEHRADUN: Vidur Bhatnagar , a 27-year-old youngster from Roorkee who had got funding worth US $1.1 million (Rs 7.1 crore) last year for his start-up venture ' Keriton ' which aims at making breast milk management easier for nurses and mothers who are feeding premature babies, has bagged the top spot in a competition which judged America’s ‘most unique small businesses’.The competition, organised by the New York-based company Paychex , decided on the winners through public voting which was open from November 25 to January 5.The results were announced last week. Bhatnagar’s company was placed first amongst 32 finalists across the US. The win got the young tech entrepreneur a cash prize of $2500. “We are elated at this recognition as it is a great motivation that will help us in striving harder to achieve our targets. The prize money will become part of our research budget,” Bhatnagar told TOI.Keriton was started by Bhatnagar , who is currently a candidate for a master’s degree in robotics at the University of Pennsylvania, during a hackathon -- an event in which computer programmers involved in software development, collaborate intensively on 'usable solutions’ — held in 2016.However, the roots of the idea were sown in 2011 when Bhatnagar’s sister delivered a premature baby who could not breastfeed for three weeks and had to be fed breast milk taken manually from the mother. The experience, the youngster says, was “so emotionally strong that it stuck with me for a very long time.” It eventually led to the development of Keriton Kare, a feeding management, lactation analytics and patient engagement platform for neonatal ICUs. The platform aims to “significantly lowers the nurses’ time spent on breast milk management, reduces errors and automatically generates an audit trail for the process.”Elaborating on the need for a comprehensive breast milk tracking and management mechanism, Bhatnagar said that his research had found that around 500,000 infants are admitted to one of the over 1,100 neonatal ICUs across the US.“Mother's breast milk is important for their survival but the process of managing the milk is fraught with errors including expired milk feedings and feeding someone's baby someone else's milk which can lead to serious diseases like HIV and Hepatitis.” He added that the problem of premature birth is especially severe in India.“India ranks at the number one slot when it comes to premature births with 3 million premature babies being born here out of the 15 million babies born prematurely worldwide. We hope to make a significant difference to the health of these babies through our endeavour,” he said adding that “we are in conversation with NICUs in India to install the Keriton Kare platform and hope to cover 5 to 8 Indian NICUs by quarter 4 of this year.”Incidentally, in March last year, Keriton had also emerged as the winner at the SXSW Impact Paediatric Pitch Competition which was judged and sponsored by 8 leading children's hospital in the US, including Stanford Children and Boston Children's Hospital. The win had got the company a cash prize of $15,000."

The head of the akhara, along with large number of members of the akhara would be participating in the major bathing in river Ganga on the occasion of Mauni Amavasya (Jan 16).“We had requested the mela authorities to allocate land for our akhara but the same was declined, this hardly means that someone can withhold us from coming to magh mela and taking a holy dip on the most auspicious bathing day (Mauniamavasya) and thus here we are, all to bath on both the occasion i.e Sankranti and Amavasya”, said Tripathi, while talking to TOI.He further said that the entire community is deeply hurt by the attitude of the all India akhara parishad and the representatives of the ‘sanathan dharm’. “There are many to block our way but very few who have embraced us with open heart, but still we will continue to strive and flight to get the respect and our right to follow the ‘sanathan dharm’ which belongs to us in the same way as it is for the saints of the parishad”.Although the akhara does not need any recognition from anyone, still coming to Sangam and taking the holy dip right under their nose is just a representation to show that we are not ready to lay down our weapon so easily, added Tripathi.Earlier, on the day, several of the members of the akhara took holy dip in the river Ganga including Pavitra Maharaj, Amrita Soni (a doctor by profession and an expert in the field of HIV) etc. The members of the akhara arrived in the mela area around noon. Surrounded by large number of lens men, the members quietly took the holy dip and chanted slogans, offering their prayer to ‘maa ganga’.The members of the akhara, who are staying at the ashram of Swami Vashudevanand Saraswati at Alopibagh, would be arriving at the mela area on January 16. “We all would be bathing in river Ganga and return by evening”, says Pavitra Maharaj."
66% rise in HIV patients in state in 8 yrs,2018-01-19,Dehradun,"News,City News,Dehradun News","Dehradun: Uttarakhand has registered a 66% increase in HIV patients in just eight years, according to the 15th HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS), a biennial exercise conducted by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). Data from HSS 2016-17 revealed that while the hill state had 4,243 people living with HIV in 2007, the number rose to 7,059 in 2015. In the same time period, Sikkim recorded a 176% rise in HIV patients, Tripura (136%), Assam (95%), Delhi (70%), Chandigarh (69%), Haryana (47%), and Punjab (58%).Additional project director (APD) of Uttarakhand State AIDS Control Society (USACS), Dr V S Tolia, said that the increase in patients in the hill state was due to expansion of diagnostic facilities in rural areas which had improved detection.In Uttarakhand, the highest rise in HIV cases - at 27.2% - was noticed among injection drug users (IDUs). A “marginal rise” in deaths of HIV patients was also observed.The highest HIV prevalence was also observed among IDUs in Mizoram (19.8%) followed by Delhi (16.2%) and Punjab (12.1%).Experts from USACS said that one reason for higher prevalence of the infection among IDUs could be due to their sharing syringes to self-administer psychotropic drugs and pain relievers.Tolia said that IDUs are encouraged to adapt Opioid substitution therapy (ORT). “In ORT, patients are motivated to take drugs orally rather than injecting them. This meets their craving for drugs and reduces risk of HIV transmission.”WHO representative to India, Henk Bekedam, said, “The latest findings show declining HIV prevalence trends in the traditionally high prevalence southern states such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. However, the results show a rise in infection in Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Bihar.”"
Colours of freedom march with ‘Pride’ on city streets,2018-01-22,Nagpur,"News,City News,Nagpur News","Nagpur: Members of LGBT community, who took out their third march in the city on January 13, were heartened to receive local government’s support. BJP MLA Milind Mane was present at the inauguration, and made his support felt by flagging off the pride march. The march took off from Samvidhan Square in the afternoon.Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil, a well-known LGBT rights activist, also graced the march, for a second time. “I like the way the pride is conducted in Nagpur. It is great to see that people who are not a part of the community have also come forward to support. Pride serves as a good platform for mainstreaming support. Moreover, this is the first time I witnessed political support to the community through the presence of Mane. Students have also come in good numbers,” he said.The march moved from RBI Square towards Zero Mile and Variety Square, crossing Rani Jhansi Square to return to Samvidhan Square. The two-hour long march saw participants enthusiastically waving the Pride colours flag. Several community members were dressed in vibrant outfits and eye catching get-ups. The march was organized by Sarathi trust, an NGO that has been actively working in support of LGBT community since over a decade.Speaking about the purpose of organizing the march, co-founder Nikunj Joshi said, “It is necessary to organize this march so that the hidden population of the community is motivated to open themselves and assert its identity. It also serves as a platform for people from the districts of Vidarbha to join the community and be motivated to organize events at their home districts.”Fourth year law students Mrudul Bhusari and Isna Khan, who came to support the march, had one common objective of attending it—This fight isn’t only about being gay or bisexual. It is a fight to protect humans. “If the physically disabled are given rights, why not to the LGBT? It will be a failure on our part if we cannot support them,” said Khan.Sohaan Nanda, a make-up artist in Bollywood who hails from the city, had come dressed as an enigmatic creature, face decorated with glitter. He said, “Three years ago, while I was still in college, people used to tease me. However, over the years, I feel that the youth in Nagpur is becoming increasingly aware about this issue. People don’t mind befriending any member from the community.”It took only about a year for Reyansh Meshram to realize his identity and disclose it to his family. He now counsels others to open up about their sexuality and helps them cope with any pressure. “I gathered courage to tell my family, and today they support me in every way they can. But it hurts me that officials such as police are not listening to members of the community,” he said.Counsellor and activist Dr Prachi Bagde, a regular supporter of LGBT rights, shared about her connection with Sarathi. “I've been working since 12 years on HIV and saw that Sarathi also had the same agenda. There is a need to oppose section 377 as it curbs rights not just of LGBT community, but also other citizens, claiming sex without procreation as unnatural.”Activist Jammu Anand, a member of Aam Aadmi Party, was also there to lend his support, and said that it angers him when the society doesn’t treat members of LGBT as human beings. “It is good to see people coming out and expressing their feelings openly. I do see a little change taking place in the city,” he said."
"India Meteorological Department: Hazy day with clouds & humidity trap pollutants, aggravate illness",2018-02-08,PUNE,"News,City News,Pune News,Civic Issues","PUNE: Winter’s almost over and summer is officially three weeks away, but Pune woke up to a cloudy morning that seemed like the monsoon on Wednesday.The mercury climbed to a humid 17 degrees C, a minimum temperature recorded for the first time this year. It was six degrees higher than normal and up from Tuesday’s 13.5 degrees C.Some parts of the city also reported light rainfall.

Katraj recorded poor air quality, data from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting Research (SAFAR), Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune showed.An IMD official said the presence of moisture around 1.5km from the earth’s surface could be a reason for hazy Wednesday. “Moisture tends to trap the pollutants emitted, which gives a hazy semblance to the day,” he said.The cloudy skies increased the humidity levels in Pune to the above normal mark. Humidity levels on Wednesday morning touched 78%, around 4% higher than the normal, while the evening turned out to be much more humid with 37% humidity, around 10% higher than the normal.The official said a deep trough in the westerlies has been causing moisture incursion. “The trough extends over the Arabian Sea and goes all the way up to the northern plains. Moisture incursion has been causing cloud development in the middle and lower levels of the atmosphere. This situation is expected to continue for another day, after which we would be able to see clearer skies. However, after the subsequent two days, a similar situation may again be witnessed,” the official said.Family physician Avinash Bhondwe told TOI that the cold season coupled with an increase in humidity levels is an unusual combination. “Such weather conditions tend to irritate the respiratory tract. We have seen a 50% increase in patients complaining of respiratory tract infections since the last three days, Wednesday showing the highest increase. Sudden temperature fluctuations further compounded this problem,” he said.Bhondwe said patients have been experiencing symptoms like mild cold, body ache, headache and fever, followed by cough.“Only symptomatic medications, without any antibiotics, are being prescribed. The fever in such conditions is typically by-phasic and stays for three to five days. Proper rest is a must to recover,” he said.He added that diabetics, pregnant women, cancer and HIV patients and others with a compromised immune system experience symptoms like severe throat pain, cough and breathlessness, they should immediately consult a physician and get checked for swine flu."
Punjab: Notice to Punjab on probe into HIV in jails,2018-01-23,CHANDIGARH,"News,City News,Chandigarh News,Civic Issues","CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday issued notice to the Punjab government, and DGP (prisons) on a plea seeking court-monitored probe into spread of HIV virus among prisoners in Punjab jails.A division bench of the HC headed by Justice Surya Kant has issued the notice after taking cognizance of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Karanveer Thamman of Banur in Rajpura tehsil of Patiala district.Referring to some media reports, the petitioner has stated in the PIL that at least 1,630 inmates in nine central jails in Punjab have tested positive for HIV. Modern Jail, Fridkot, has the highest number of 439 HIV positive inmates, while Bathinda has 30, Ferozepur 322, Amritsar 299, Kapurthala 210, Ludhiana 137, Patiala 75, Hoshiarpur 63 and Gurdaspur 55.According to the petitioner, spread of HIV positive disease among jail inmates is caused due to sharing of syringes (used for taking drugs) and through sexual contact.The jail authorities avoid their responsibility by contending that medical examination of persons is not done before lodging them into Jails. Thus, the high incidence of HIV positive cases amongst jail inmates is taking place with connivance of jail officials, and an independent probe should be conducted by a high powered team of retired and honest police officers, advocates and retired judges, the petitioner argued. He added that such team would bring out the true reasons for spread of HIV positive cases among jail inmates. It was further argued that the measures suggested by such a team will go a long way in preventing HIV positive from spreading its wings in jails.The counsel also pleaded that conducting of medical examination and maintaining of records of such medical examination of persons before lodging them into jail, would prevent spread of this dreadful disease further, and conducting of periodical examination of jail inmates would help fixing responsibility of jail officials, if such a person (who did not test positive for HIV) is later found to be inflicted with the virus.The matter would now come up for hearing on March 12."
"Kamathipura: Humanising Kamathipura’s sex workers, one gritty story at a time",2018-01-23,"When Lal Batti Express , the play by daughters of sex workers of Kamathipura , pulled over in Hyderabad for its India premier on Sunday evening, over 3,000 Hyderabadis hopped on it making the hall look like a Mumbai local train, packed to the hilt. And thus, the audience was ready to chug along with the 10 performers, all born to sex workers and trafficked at a young age, to get a peek into the dark alleys of Kamathipura, one of Asia’s oldest and largest red light districts. The 90-minute-long interactive play took the audience through four ‘stations’ in the lives of children born and raised in brothels. To break the ice and highlight the deeply-ingrained stereotypes about sex workers in the public psyche, the play began by asking volunteers from the audience to pose as a shy girl; a Muslim; a transgender, and finally, a 13-year-old sex worker on stage. The idea was to make the audience realise that sex workers too are human beings and they too have emotions like us. The exercise evoked strong reactions from the audience with some admitting that they could have never imagined what sex workers go through, had it not been for this play.Laden with high emotional points, the play was less dramatic, and more narrative. By using bed sheets as a metaphor for prostitution, the actors highlighted their struggles by battling with the sheets, before neatly folding and keeping them aside, thus signifying how they have accepted their troubled pasts and moved on.By giving each of the 10 actors’ stories a distinct voice, the play showcased how each woman dealt with her struggles and overcame them in her unique way.

"‘Don’t advertise HIV-positive status, write ‘universal precaution’ instead’",2018-01-24,CHANDIGARH,,"CHANDIGARH: For HIV-positive people to get medical attention without being harassed, health practitioners should put “universal precaution” and not their HIV status on medical cards, says Puja Thakur, HIV-positive activist for the cause.At a TOI event related to the national girl child campaign, she talked about the harassment that the HIV-positive people face in hospitals where they go in search of medication. She said: “My husband refused to go to hospital because laboratory technicians would ask him awkward questions like whether he had any extra-marital affair. The law says the HIV-positive status is not to be disclosed, so why is on the pateints’ medical cards?”She pointed out that the medical term for HIV-positive is “universal precaution”, about which only a few people know. She urged the health department to promote the term so that patients are treated with dignity. Disclosure of their HIV-positive status renders patients vulnerable to harassment at the hands of chemists, who pry into their medical history and personal life.No school is ready to accept her children. Local MP Kirron Kher found it strange that doctors were writing the HIV-positive status on medical cards.

The director of State Aids Control Society supported her treatment and got her life back on track. She now works for the Chandigarh HIV-positive Society “This medical problem gave me a mission of life,” Pooja said. “To make myself aware of the legal rights of HIV-postitive people, I resumed my education,” she said. She was a matriculate when she got married and completed her graduation after family disowned her. She plans to get a master’s degree in social work and keep working for the rights of HIV-positive people. During the 2010 IPL season, she was “toss ka boss” for a match."
"High court: Government can jail a prisoner, but can’t deny conjugal rights",2018-01-25,"MADURAI The wife of a prisoner who suffers because of her marital relationship cannot be denied her legitimate right to have a child, ruled the Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday.Acting on a petition filed by Meharaj, wife of Siddique Ali alias Sulthan, a 40-year-old life convict incarcerated at the Palayamkottai central jail for eighteen years, a division bench of justices S Vimala and T Krishnavalli permitted the prisoner to go on a two-week leave to assist his 32-yearold wife in infertility treatment. The court also ordered the constitution of a committee to consider the possibility of providing conjugal visits to eligible prisoners.Brushing aside the prosecution’s opposition, the bench said that psychologists and psychiatrists believed that frustration, tension, ill-feeling and heart burnings could be reduced in a human being if they are allowed conjugal relationship. Conjugal visits strengthen bond and safeguard families from becoming dysfunctional due to prolonged isolation and lack of sexual contact.The court said, “It is also reported that there are innumerable cases of HIV/AIDS in jail because of sexual intercourse between the same gender. This evil is happening because of deprivation of conjugal relationship for a prisoner.” Hence, it was the right time for the government to constitute a committee to consider the possibility of providing conjugal visit and provide the facility to eligible prisoners subject to precautions.The court pointed out that some countries recognised conjugal visits of the spouse as a prisoner’s right. When the prisons were overcrowded, providing place for it might be a problem, but the government had to find a solution. The inmates were entitled, if they wished, to give their sperm to their spouse for artificial insemination.In this regard, the bench also cited the saying of the first president of South Africa Nelson Mandela , that no one truly knew a nation until one was inside its jails and a nation should not be judged by how it treated its highest citizens, but its lowest ones. “Being human beings, prisoners also would like to share their problems with their life partner as well as the society.

Tanzanian scientist battles combo of diseases,2018-01-26,Chennai,"News,City News,Chennai News","Chennai: After a kidney transplant at a Chennai-based hospital in 2005, Tanzania-based Pius Z Yanda thought he could return to his research on climate change . But his problems didn’t end there as he realised other ailments such as cancer, HIV/AIDS and heart disease had found a safe haven in his body before he went in for his second renal transplant in 2016.Speaking at an event here on Thursday, Yanda kept the audience comprising doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, counsellors, patients and caregivers spellbound as he narrated the crisis he faced in his homeland. “Today, I am happy. I encourage many renal failure patients in my country to remain positive,” he told participants at the 25th Annual Charity and Awards Nite of Tamilnad Kidney Research Foundation(TANKER).Admitting that it wasn’t easy when doctors first told him that he had renal failure in 2005, he recalled, “My legs were swollen. I was feeling uncomfortable. Terms like high urea and creatinine seemed like Chinese to me.” When doctors told him he required renal transplant, he arranged funds and came to the Madras Medical Mission where he underwent the procedure and was discharged five weeks later.A few months later, he found that there were painless lesions on his limbs. A series of tests confirmed Kaposi’s sarcoma, a type of cancer that forms in the lining of blood and lymph vessels. “This was a side effect of the immune suppressant I was taking to keep the new kidney safe,” he said.After a series of cancer treatment methods, including chemotherapy and a change in drug regimen, Yanda badly wanted to visit his parents in 2011. That’s when the next bad news hit him. “I developed food poisoning and had heavy intestinal bleeding. The duty doctor had the option of giving me blood transfusion immediately or letting me die. He chose to transfuse blood. I was infected with HIV, but I was still alive,” he recalled.When the Madras Medical Mission confirmed HIV infection, he and his family broke down. “I knelt down and prayed,” he said. His country had good facilities to care for people with HIV/AIDS and he received anti-retroviral therapy, the drug of choice for people with HIV/AIDS.But by 2015, his condition worsened. This time, besides a severe infection in the heart, he also had a second renal failure. In 2016, he underwent the second organ transplant. “My country needs to have better awareness, prevention, early screening and specialists who can care for people with kidney diseases. I do what I can to help them,” he said.He received an award from Sundram Finance MD TT Srinivasaraghavan. “I am here today to thank the doctors and hospital staff.” On Sunday, he will be flying to Geneva to speak on climate change on behalf of a UN organisation he is chairing.TANKER Foundation gave away awards to Ahmedabad-based Dr Vivek Kute for research, Dr KV Kishore Kumar of the Banyan, Nadiad-based Dr RM Manohar for life time achievement and Jayashree Ravindran of Ability Foundation for creating awareness."

Elisa: Kerala opts for latest Elisa test kit for HIV detection,2018-01-29,THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,"News,City News,Thiruvananthapuram News,Civic Issues","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS) has decided to go with 4th generation Elisa test, instead of nucleic acid-based test, to detect HIV in the window period. A study conducted by the society has found that the Elisa test was more effective than nucleic test.HIV screening had become a matter of concern following the detection of the virus in a kid, who underwent blood transfusion at Regional Cancer Centre. Now, National AIDS Control Organisation has informed that it would supply Elisa test kits to the state.""For the time being, we have supplied enough kits to all government medical college hospitals and Regional Cancer Centre. Moreover, Kerala State Medical Services Corporation (KMSCL) has also been asked to procure the kits, which will be supplied to all the blood banks and hospitals with blood banks,'' said Dr R Ramesh , managing director of KSACS.As per the study, in the nucleic test the virus could not be detected even for a week after the blood is collected. ""But Elisa test gives more accurate result even during the first one week window period,'' said Dr Ramesh.In the past one year, KSACS collected 4 lakh blood units, of which 300 were detected with HIV using the third generation Elisa test. ""In the past four years, we might have collected about 25 lakh blood units and only in one case it has gone undetected (in the RCC incident). Hence our testing facilities are accurate. With this 4th generation test, we can assure 100% safety and accuracy,'' he pointed out.Now, KSACS has decided to go for a wide-spread campaign for voluntary blood donation since it is the only safe way for collecting the blood units.""We have achieved only 60% in voluntary blood donation and the remaining is still replacement blood donation. The latter is always risky,'' he said.Catch 25, a campaign to encourage youths in the age group 18 to 25 for voluntary blood donation will be launched by KSACS.""We have found that most of high-risk groups are above 30 years and hence it would be safe if we could promote voluntary blood donation among youngsters below 25 years,'' said Dr Ramesh."

Generic medicines remain out of reach for patients across state: Study,2018-01-30,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: India may be famo- threaten to boycott exams us for its generic drugs, but patients seeking medicines for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS or malaria may not find affordable brands easily in shops across Maharashtra This is the gist of a study published in the latest edition of the Journal of Global Health that looked at the availability of six essential medicines in 124 private pharmacies across the state, including Mumbai. The study, done by the researchers at Newcastle University in the UK and in Mumbai, found that the policy to open up the market has generated a large number of brands of medicines, but there are still not enough available in the pharmacies.“What is worrying is that despite efforts to increase availability through market competition, there remains inadequate access to essential medicines,” said the study’s lead author Dr Colin Millard from Newcastle University. “We found that multiple brands of selected medicines are listed in professional and commercial databases -running into thousands -- yet only a small fraction was available in private pharmacies.”The study found 2,186 approved products of the selected medicines in Indian databases, but the Pharmatrac database listed only 1,359 brands of these medicines.The study looked at drugs needed for six common conditions: Artemisinin (for malaria), lamivudine (HIV/AIDS), rifampicin (TB control), oxytocin (reproductive health), fluoxetine (mental health) and metformin (diabetes).While the diabetes drug was available in 92% of the chemist shops, rifampicin was found in 64.5% of the chemists. The other four were available at less than 50% of the shops. Worse, only a small number of brands dominated the market, suggesting that powerful pharmaceutical companies influenced what is stocked and sold.Concurring, Dr Abhijit More of the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan said that generic medicines at affordable costs are not easily available across the country.“There hasn’t been adequate governmental intervention with regard to sales practices by pharmaceutical companies. The Hathi Committee had years back recommended that medicine strips mention the generic names in big and bold print and brand names in smaller print, but this recommendation has not been implemented,” he said. He said pure generic versions of drugs are not available in most cities."
malaria: Fighting malaria: Hope of drug to provide immunity,2018-01-31,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Hyderabad News,Civic Issues","HYDERABAD: In a major step towards development of vaccine for Falciparum malaria , researchers from the city-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology ( CCMB ) have identified a protein that could provide immunity against the deadly malarial parasite.The protein, technically known as Plasmoretropsin, provides defence against Falciparum malaria, the deadliest of the four malarial types circulating in India at present. The other malarial types – vivax, ovale and malariae – are relatively mild, though they are often deadly. Interestingly, Plasmoretropsin is used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ). The researchers have found that Plasmoretropsin provides immunity in subsequent infection of malaria and thus it could emerge as a candidate for vaccine against malaria.The research finding was presented at the ongoing International Congress of Cell Biology (ICCB – 2018) here on Tuesday. Biologists from the around the world are attending the fiveday mega scientific event. The CCMB is the local host. The research is led by Puran S Sijwali , principal scientist at the CCMB. His lab is involved in researching the mechanisms of pathogenesis in malarial parasite and investigating new targets for drug development.Plasmoretropsin is an essential Plasmodium protein. It is a target of HIV protease inhibitors. According to the researchers, HIV protease inhibitors block the development of malaria parasites. Inclusion of HIV protease inhibitors in the treatment of malaria confers some level of protection against subsequent Plasmodium infections. To identify the target of HIV protease inhibitors, the CCMB team investigated Plasmoretropsin.This protein is expressed in all major stages of the malarial parasite, and undergoes limited processing, which was inhibited by HIV protease inhibitors. Over-expression of this protein rendered malarial parasites less susceptible to HIV protease inhibitors compared to the wild type parasites.They said the gene controlling Plasmoretropsin could not be knocked out. A knock-down of Plasmoretropsin at the protein level drastically compromised the growth of malarial parasite and its virulence.The CCMB team conducted the study in mouse model. Prior infection of mice with Plasmoretropsin knock-down parasites conferred immunity to subsequent infections. This is because of the immune responses against the parasite.“Our data demonstrates that Plasmoretropsin is essential for malarial parasite development. It could be a target of HIV protease inhibitors, and a candidate for generating a whole organism malaria vaccine,” the researchers said."

First national-level marriage fair for HIV+ people in Hazira,2018-01-06,Surat,"News,City News,Surat News","Surat: HIV-positive people seeking life partners from more than 10 states in the country will descend on Hazira near Surat to participate in a marriage fair or ‘jeevansathi pasandgi mela’ being organized on Saturday.The first of its kind national marriage fair is being organized by Gujarat State Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (GSNP+), a non-governmental organization (NGO) offering free consultation services for HIV positive brides and grooms, in association with Reliance Industries Limited (RIL).The marriage fair for the HIV positive people is being organized every year for the last 10 years. It started from Surat and then expanded to include HIV positive marriage seekers of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. This is first time that the HIV positive people seeking life partners will be arriving in the city from more than 10 states across the country.If the volunteers of GSNP+ are to be believed then around 800 registrations of the HIV positive people seeking life partners have come in from Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, New Delhi, Punjab, West Bengal, Rajasthan and two other states.“Unlike every year, this time around we have expanded our marriage mela to more than 10 states in the country. The marriage mela is going to be unique this time as marriage seekers will have a broad choice to select their life partners from different states,” GSNP+ president Daxa Patel said.There is a higher proportion of infected men as compared to women. Owing to higher proportion of infected men, prospective brides usually get a greater freedom in choosing their partners.The marriage mela will be held at Reliance HIV and TB Centre at Hazira where men would walk up on stage and formally introduce themselves, talking about their profession and income, in front of an audience comprising mostly prospective brides and their family members.“The prospective grooms and brides have freedom to choose their partners as they walk on stage and talk about themselves. Once the groom and bride like each other, the next stage will be to consult their parents or relatives besides mutual consent,” Patel said. She said for the first time female participants in the marriage mela will be reimbursed all their travelling and other expenses with the help of Reliance Foundation."
State health dept pads up for drug sensitivity test of fresh TB patients,2018-01-07,PUNE,"News,City News,Pune News","PUNE: The state health department will focus on strengthening its sample collection and transportation (to testing centres) system to ensure effective roll out of the universal drug sensitivity test ( DST ) for every newly diagnosed TB patient.“We received the Union health ministry’s order to roll out universal DST for every newly diagnosed TB patients on Thursday. We have already started strengthening all the four important components of the diagnostics, including collection (of samples), transportation (of sample), testing and reporting (of data),” state tuberculosis officer Sanjeev Kamble told TOI.State reports about 1.30 lakh new TB patients every year. To detect drug resistance, the patient’s sputum is tested on GeneXpert, a new imported diagnostic device that detects drug-resistant TB in less than two hours.Currently, Maharashtra has 73 high-end GeneXpert machines, which are functioning at state-run network of health centres. To speed up the testing, the Union health ministry has agreed to give 42 additional GeneXpert machines to the state, state health officials said.“The additional 42 machines will be set up at a few more sub-district and rural hospitals, corporation-run health centres and even hospitals attached to private medical colleges. We have already received around 10 new machines. Once we install all the 42 GeneXpert machines, we will be able to implement the universal DST across the state. This will happen in another 10 to 15 days,” Kamble said.With the testing part being taken care of, what is needed now is to strengthen the sample collection and sample transportation (to testing centres) system mainly at state’s rural interiors and periphery, expert said.“We have field staff to collect sputum samples of patients, put them in sterile containers and transport them to nearest testing centres. Now, we have to strengthen this collection and transportation system in rural parts and periphery for smooth implementation of universal DST,” Kamble said.Till now, TB patients in Maharashtra used to undergo the drug susceptibility test when even after two months of treatment their sputum tested positive for the disease, indicating resistance to prescribed drugs. The test was also carried out on patients reporting relapse of TB, and the HIV-infected who tested positive for the disease, as they are considered highly vulnerable."
Digital tracking of Tamil Nadu HIV patients in works,2018-01-08,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Civic Issues","CHENNAI: Medical records of HIV patients in the state will now go digital. The Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) will initiate the project on a pilot basis at the antiretroviral therapy centres in Madras Medical College and at the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Egmore, which have around 5,000 HIV-positive patients enrolled in the state programme.K Senthil Raj, TANSACS project director, said the patients will also be given a login id, so that they can access their records, including lab results and next appointment with doctors, through their phones. “Starting from the counsellor to the staff nurse and then finally the doctor, details of the patients will be fed into the system. The doctors will have a dashboard with the patient’s medical history,” he said.At present, 1.2 lakh people with HIV are on the antiretroviral therapy programme run by the government.Officials say once a patient tests positive for HIV, the ART centre maintains a ‘white card’ with the patient’s details, while the patient is given a notebook that carries information on their drugs intake and their CD4 count – an important indicator of the immune function and the strongest predictor of HIV progression. A doctor at an ART centre here said many of these cards are simply discarded. “Walk into any of these centres and you will see these cards lying in some corner, gathering dust. We usually refer to the notebooks these patients bring. Mostly we go by the information they provide,” admitted the doctor.The TANSACS director, too, said poor documentation was a problem. “We also have duplication. A patient who registers at an ART centre in one district later moves to a centre in another district and enrolls as a new patient,” he said, adding that maintaining electronic records will do away with this challenge. “We will also be able to track them better.”Tamil Nadu has AIDS testing centres at all district headquarters with more than 55 ART centres and 750 Integrated (Voluntary) and Confidential Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) under the National AIDS Control Programme at district level government hospitals and medical colleges across the state. Patients, who are confirmed HIV-positive, visit ART centres at least once a month for drugs and testing.While NGOs and experts working with people living with HIV have welcomed the move, they said digitalisation could also raise concerns on privacy. “Many of them lie low as they don’t want people around them to know they are infected. They will be wary if they know their details are available online. The state needs to assuage this by holding awareness camps,” said Vijay Raman from Voluntary Health Services which undertakes projects related to HIV/AIDS among the transgender community.In an effort to fight misinformation on sexually transmitted infections and diseases, the Tamil Nadu state AIDS control society will soon revamp its website to make it more interactive. Public can clarify doubts about condom use, STDs and STIs by emailing a group of counsellors dedicated for this. The website will be launched on January 11."
HIV wanes in Maha but rages in high-risk groups,2018-01-08,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News,Civic Issues News","MUMBAI: The recently released HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) report has some good as well as worrying news for the state. The good news is that the deadly viral disease continues to be on a decline among general population. The worrying part: In certain pockets of the state, the disease is raging among high-risk populations like female sex workers.According to the HSS, Maharashtra is 16th in terms of HIV prevalence, a positive shift of four places since the last survey in 2014-15. From 0.29%, the prevalence has reduced to 0.26%. An official from the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) said it was a significant drop as the HIV prevalence is now lower than the national average of 0.28%.But experts say it’s still not time to rejoice as certain sites catering to high-risk populations such as men having sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users and female sex workers have shown a significant prevalence. Though Maharashtra is one of the states to record less than 5% HIV positivity in female sex workers, there are four sites where the prevalence has been found to be 5%. At one site, it was around 10%. Among the female sex workers in the state, the prevalence (3.48%) is more than double the national average (1.56%).Nagpur-based NGO Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) that has been working with female sex workers said migration has emerged as a major challenge over the years. “Commercial sex workers have started migrating and moving out of traditional pockets making it difficult to track, test or treat them. It poses a direct threat to the general population,” said Hemlata Lohave from IRCS. She added that dwindling financial resources, too, have made their job difficult. “Often we are working without funds for months. Even now, for instance, we haven’t received money for the last quarter. We regularly lose trained workers as we can’t pay salaries,” she said.Among MSMs, the state is fifth on the national chart with the prevalence hovering around 4.69%, which is higher than the national average of 2.69%. However, in HSS 2014-15, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers was 7.4% and 4.9% among MSMs.Mumbai, too, is one of the sites with high HIV prevalence among truckers. There were nine sites with more than 1% HIV prevalence among long-distance truckers, including Mumbai with 1.2% prevalence.The MDACS official said the state is working on newer strategies. “We are aware that infections are still high in metropolitan cities. In high-risk pockets, we are testing at the community level. We are also looking at multi-month dispensation of antiretroviral drugs so that a patient can come to us once in three months rather than every month,” he said."
STD alarm: Drugs fail to control gonorrhea,2018-01-08,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Hyderabad News,Civic Issues","HYDERABAD: Multi-drug resistant strains of sexually transmitted disease, gonorrhea, have been found by Osmania and Gandhi Medical College researchers along with scientists of ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute Pune.Emergence of multi-drug resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a big public health challenge in controlling sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), say experts. At least 124 strains of gonorrhea causative were isolated in past few years in Delhi, Pune, Mumbai, Secunderabad and Hyderabad to determine antimicrobial susceptibility.Research findings by Syeeda A Muqeeth of Gandhi Medical College, G Sasikala of Osmania along with others were recently published in Journal of Medical Microbiology. At least 20 cases were examined in Secunderabad and 16 in Hyderabad.Researchers said, 98% isolates of gonorrhea were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 52% to penicillin, 56% to tetracycline and 5% to azithromycin.It was found all strains were susceptible to spectinomycin, ceftriaxone and cefixime, barring two strains which showed decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefixime. “We demonstrated emergence of decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefixime and threshold levels of resistance to azithromycin in India. The findings underscore the importance of maintaining continued surveillance on antibiotic resistance to gonorrhoea and a potential need for a strategic change in guidelines in future,” researchers said. World Health Organisation in 2017, while advising health authorities said the data from 77 countries revealed that antibiotic resistance is making gonorrhea difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat.Decreasing condom use, increasing urbanization and travel, poor infection detection rates and inadequate or failed treatment are contributing to the increase, according to WHO.Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad, consultant physician Dr Hari Kishan Boorugu told TOI, “Gonorrhea has increased in last two decades because of rising HIV infection. Penicillin used to be the drug of choice. However, there has been increasing resistance since late nineties. This study indicates rising resistance similar to that found in other studies from the West. Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice now, and this study warns about potential emergence of drug resistance to ceftriaxone and cefixime as well.”He said, “Though most strains are susceptible to this drug, there is a risk of an increase in resistance to ceftriaxone as it’s a commonly used drug in our country, including for typhoid. There is high resistance to other commonly used drugs like ciprofloxacin and azithromycin. We need to focus more on prevention which is essentially safe sex practices, by using condoms.”Experts said research and development for developing new drugs for gonorrhea are not favourable as only three new drugs are in clinical development stage."

"EWS admissions: Activists fret over age bar, ‘relief’ to private schools",2018-01-11,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Delhi News","NEW DELHI: The directorate of education (DoE) has decided to start the admission process for economically weaker sections ( EWS ) and disadvantaged groups ( DG ) from January 22 While the forms for 25% seats reserved in each school can be filled up and submitted online till February 21, the first computerised draw of lots for entry-level classes (nursery, KG and Class I) will be held on March 7. This year, children with HIV have also been included in the DG category.However, DoE’s decision to impose an upper-age limit and allow private schools to report any change in their neighbourhood list have left activists unhappy.DoE has given private schools four days from January 15 to report “corrections, updates or suggestions” about the residential areas comprising their neighbourhoods. As per the norms, an applicant feeds his area of residence following which a choice of schools in that neighbourhood gets selected. Schools have also not been asked to upload their vacancies online.Meanwhile, an upper age limit has been imposed on the EWS/DG aspirants, though a similar condition was not implemented for general category students.Activists have called the notification an example of “a nexus between DoE and the schools”, claiming that schools will have an option of getting rid of certain neighbourhoods. “Private schools have gone to courts so many times stating that they don’t want EWS students. But now they have the authority to exclude jhuggis from their neighborhood,” said Khagesh Jha, a lawyer-activist.He said that as per the LG’s notification on January 7, 2011, parents had the authority to decide their neighbourhood. “Now why are the schools being given that option instead?”However, senior DoE officials said getting neighbourhood details from five lakh parents would be a cumbersome task, and so the schools have been asked to report to the zonal committees. “We will not allow schools to delete any neighbourhood,” an official stressed, adding that around 150 local workers of the department have been teamed up for five zones to take school recommendations. “But they will only listen. Not all suggestions will be accepted.”Slamming the upper-age decision, Jha claimed this would throw even disabled students, who otherwise don’t have any age-limit imposition, out of the system.DoE officials justified the decision, saying anyway all private schools have been informally imposing an upper-age limit even for general students. “DoE has not asked them to put a limit, but to carry on as they have the previous years,” said the official. “We had to impose a limit for EWS as last year we had 12-year-old children being admitted to nursery,” he added."

In 2016, 11 babies had been abandoned,” he said and added the cases of HIV positive mothers abandoning their babies were not common in the city.R Riyaz of orphanage Mercy Home said that the 22-year-old woman had given birth to the child in Theni. Her husband left her as she had been travelling to various cities and staying in orphanages. “Childline sent the woman and the baby to Mercy Home on January 20. On 28, she left the home saying she wanted to visit her family in Pollachi. As she did not return, we informed officials and handed over the baby to the CMCH,” Riyaz said.He said the stigma of HIV was still persistent in the society. “Even rich families abandon children. We have 30 children aged between 5 and 21 in our home. Four months ago, we helped a woman and man, both HIV positive, to get married. They are planning a baby as well. Now there is treatment to ensure HIV negative child for such couple,” Riyaz said.He, however, said seldom does one come forward to adopt abandoned children. “Many have been abandoned after pressure from the society and relatives,” Riyaz added."
NIV technology allows testing of deadly viruses at small labs,2018-02-01,PUNE,"News,City News,Pune News,Civic Issues","PUNE: Scientists at the city-based National Institute of Virology ( NIV ) have developed a breakthrough technology which promises to revolutionize the present procedure of testing deadly viruses in India and abroad.The scientists have developed compounds, which can be added to blood collection tubes (vacutainer) to instantly render a wide range of viruses non-infectious, without affecting their cell structure. Thus, the method eliminates bio-risks involved in handling deadly viruses, making their testing possible even at common laboratories. Eventually, it eliminates the need to test such samples at highly secured bio-safety labs , eliminating huge expenses on logistics and delays in diagnosis.“The technology has the potential to change the way clinical laboratories are currently functioning across the world. It can protect laboratory workers from viruses and ensure safe experimenting with highly infectious agents even at common laboratories,” senior scientist and NIV director Devendra Mourya told TOI.The method, scientists said, will come in handy in countries like India where there is a dearth of highly-equipped containment laboratories.The NIV has handed over the novel technology to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), an apex body in the country for the formulation, coordination and promotion of biomedical research, for commercial transfer to industry.“The technology is indigenous, cost-effective and can be easily incorporated in the manufacturing process of blood collection tubes in India and elsewhere. Our only rider is that the manufacturing companies have to supply the tubes containing the compounds at cheaper rates to make it accessible to every lab in the country,” Mourya said.The reagents or chemical compounds that render the viruses inactive remain stable and effective even at room temperature. They don’t need to be kept or preserved in cold temperature.“Most importantly, the inactivation of the viruses does not affect biochemical, haematological, serological and molecular tests. This is precisely where scientists working on developing similar methods in different parts of the world have failed in the past,” Mourya said.The scientists have validated the efficacy of the formulation against viruses that include Japanese Encephalitis, Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), dengue, chikungunya, Chandipura and Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). Among these viruses, CCHF and KFD are highly lethal and can be transmitted between humans via close contact with blood or other body fluid.“Viruses like CCHF and KFD need biosafety level 3 and 4 laboratories for carrying out the test. Hence, blood samples of a suspected patient are always sent to these labs as testing of these viruses should only be conducted under maximum biological containment conditions,” Mourya said.Asked if the compounds will be equally effective in inactivating HIV-AIDS virus and bacterium that causes tuberculosis, Mourya said, “We didn’t try our compounds on the AIDS virus and TB bacterium, but we are confident that they will get inactivated easily as the viruses on which we validated them are more potent than these.”In addition to validating the inactivation formula against all the five viruses at NIV, experts at the government-run Sawai Man Singh Medical College in Jaipur and King George’s Medical University in Lucknow also validated the efficacy of the technology independently between November and December last year.“The inactivation method is very helpful in transporting the samples from long distance, especially when we are dealing with an unknown biohazard. Besides, it does not compromise various diagnostic parameters,” said senior microbiologist Amita Jain, professor and head, Virus Research and Diagnostic Lab, King George Medical University.Senior microbiologist Bharti Malhotra of SMS Medical College in Jaipur said, “The newly developed reagents or formulation by NIV scientists inactivate the virus but do not interfere with serological and molecular testing. It is very useful in our country.”Another NIV scientist Gajanan N Sapkal said, “The inactivation formulation (which are well-established chemical compounds in liquid form) can be added with other blood preserving substances that are usually thin coatings applied using ultrasonic nozzle during the manufacturing of blood collection tubes. Hence, there are no complexities involved in using the technology. Everything is taken care of during the manufacturing of the tubes.”Sapkal was involved in testing the inactivation of viruses at the experimental level and also during the field evaluation studies."
"IMD: Hazy day with clouds and humidity traps pollutants, aggravates illness",2018-02-13,PUNE,"News,City News,Pune News,Civic Issues","PUNE: Winter’s almost over and summer is officially three weeks away, but Pune woke up to a cloudy morning that seemed like the monsoon on Wednesday.The mercury climbed to a humid 17 degrees C, a minimum temperature recorded for the first time this year. It was six degrees higher than normal and up from Tuesday’s 13.5 degrees C.Some parts of the city also reported light rainfall. The unusual weather, coupled with an increase in pollution in some parts, aggravated health problems, with a rise in respiratory tract infections in the city.The India Meteorological Department IMD ) said medium and low clouds are persisting over central Maharashtra, causing minimum temperatures to increase higher than the normal by five to six degrees.With an increase in moisture, pollution levels seemed higher in some locations on Wednesday. Katraj recorded poor air quality, data from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting Research (SAFAR), Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune showed.An IMD official said the presence of moisture around 1.5km from the earth’s surface could be a reason for hazy Wednesday. “Moisture tends to trap the pollutants emitted, which gives a hazy semblance to the day,” he said.The cloudy skies increased the humidity levels in Pune to the above normal mark. Humidity levels on Wednesday morning touched 78%, around 4% higher than the normal, while the evening turned out to be much more humid with 37% humidity, around 10% higher than the normal.The official said a deep trough in the westerlies has been causing moisture incursion. “The trough extends over the Arabian Sea and goes all the way up to the northern plains. Moisture incursion has been causing cloud development in the middle and lower levels of the atmosphere. This situation is expected to continue for another day, after which we would be able to see clearer skies. However, after the subsequent two days, a similar situation may again be witnessed,” the official said.Family physician Avinash Bhondwe told TOI that the cold season coupled with an increase in humidity levels is an unusual combination. “Such weather conditions tend to irritate the respiratory tract. We have seen a 50% increase in patients complaining of respiratory tract infections since the last three days, Wednesday showing the highest increase. Sudden temperature fluctuations further compounded this problem,” he said.Bhondwe said patients have been experiencing symptoms like mild cold, body ache, headache and fever, followed by cough.“Only symptomatic medications, without any antibiotics, are being prescribed. The fever in such conditions is typically by-phasic and stays for three to five days. Proper rest is a must to recover,” he said.He added that diabetics, pregnant women, cancer and HIV patients and others with a compromised immune system experience symptoms like severe throat pain, cough and breathlessness, they should immediately consult a physician and get checked for swine flu."
"Unnao: 5,000 people living with HIV fear in UP town",2018-02-08,BANGARMAU ( UNNAO ),"News,City News,Lucknow News,Civic Issues","BANGARMAU ( UNNAO ): Prem Ganj , a settlement of about 5,000 people, is living under the shadow of an unknown fear. Deep Chand (name changed), sobbing inconsolably , is an embodiment of that mortifying scare. In the past three months, 38 people from this locality of Bangarmau tehsil have been found HIV positive at screening camps in the past three months. The needle of suspicion is pointed towards a quack, Rajendra Yadav , who has been held.Till a few months ago, Deep Chand was just like most men from Prem Ganj, working as a 'palledar' (loader) at the nearby grain market. But a few months ago, his body started saying 'no' to humongous sacks he would carry on his back to make a living. Continuous excruciating pain in the lower back took him to Yadav's Station Road clinic in Bangarmau, the destination for many in his neighbourhood needing cheap medical help. But relief eluded him. Last month, at a camp in Prem Ganj to screen HIV cases he, along with his wife and son, tested positive. Now, he has to report to Kanpur ART Centre, 50 km away, for regular check-up and medication which is free.He also has four daughters. But fearing worst, he has not made them undergo the test. ""I am not fit and don't earn like before. What will happen if they, too, are tested positive? Medicine is free, but I don't have money to take six people to Kanpur. I can't even afford the cost of copies and pencils,"" he vents his angst.Two other nearby villages under the virus onslaught are Chakmeera and Kidmiyapur. Among the victims is a 70-year-old and also six-year-old girl. Her parents, however, are not infected. This has flummoxed local health officials.Rajendra Yadav, who would run his clinic from the corridor of an old Sanskrit school on the Station Road and is said to have infected many from the locality with infected syringes, was Dr 'Fixit' for the people. As per Deepu, a local youth, patients would make a beeline before his clinic before he would open it at 9am. Till the time he would call it a day around 11pm, he would have seen more than 150 patients.""People from adjoining areas would also throng his dispensary. He used to charge Rs 10 for three doses of medicine and an injection shot. He would carry a 'jhola' in which he usually kept his medical kit, including used syringes, which he would wash from the hand-pump water,"" Deepu says.Prem Ganj came under the radar of health officials in November last when 13 people from the locality tested HIV positive at a camp held by UP State Aids Control Society. At three repeat camps in the last week of January, 25 more cases popped up. “Nearly 270 people from Prem Ganj had got themselves examined at the camps out of which 25 tested positive. Now, people are scared and are not willing to get themselves tested,” says Sunil Kumar, a local municipal corporator."
"20,500 got HIV through blood transfusion in 11 years: Data",2018-02-08,CHENNAI ,"News,City News,Chennai News,Civic Issues","CHENNAI : A day after reporting how 21 people in Uttar Pradesh got infected with HIV due to use of unsafe medical device, TOI has sourced government records that show 20,592 people across the country contracted HIV due to blood transfusions since 2007. Naco ) data shows Gujarat has the largest number of HIV positive cases due to blood transfusion. In the state, which is above national average in terms of prevalence and seventh in the country in general prevalence, nearly one in every five cases reported is recorded as caused due to blood transfusion. Tamil Nadu, which stands 11th in general prevalence, has reported 1,134 cases due to blood transfusion , coming sixth in the category.The data is based on information provided by patients at Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) run by the National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco). Experts said that there could be misreporting as patients tend to give blood transfusion as the reason to hide unsafe sex.Doctors said a person could contract HIV through blood transfusion if the blood bank is not equipped with fourth generation (ELISA) testing kits.“Third generation kits used in government health centreshave the ability todetect the infection only after 8-12 weeks. Fourth generation kitscan detectit as early as from the fourth week,” said Dr A Sathish Kumar from Solidarity and Action Against HIV Infection in India (SAATHI), an organisation working with HIV patients across the country.There have been instances where individuals have donated blood without knowing that they are HIV positive. The fourth generation kit detects infections in thewindow period and blood donated by them can be rejected straight away, said a former AIDS Control Society Official . “Naco has been allocated close to ₹1,600 crore. Authorities should procure the latest testing kits,” he said.Kerala has in January announced that these stateof-the-art devices would soon be installed in its hospitals after a nine-year-old tested positive for HIV after blood transfusion. Private labs equipped with latest kits and charge ₹300 - ₹1,000 for HIV screening."
quacks operating in village: HIV scare puts quacks under lens,2018-02-08,BHOPAL,"News,City News,Bhopal News,Crime","BHOPAL: The risk of HIV infection through used needles is a clear and present danger in rural Madhya Pradesh , as nearly 50% of quacks operating in villages have no formal training and zero awareness on the virus.Reports of a quack in Uttar Pradesh infecting 58 people with HIV by using infected needles have shaken the MP government into the need to monitor quacks, who roam around the hinterland posing as doctors. The health department issued fresh guidelines to all district chief medical and health officers (CMHO) on Wednesday to rein in these frauds.What adds to the worry is that Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society does not list these cases in its HIV sentinel surveillance. As per MPSACS data, there are 7,021 intravenous drug users being monitored at their anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. Sources say 28 of them (0.4%) were infected with HIV due to the behavioural practices of addicts — sharing needles. The data does not say if the infection was attributed to quacks.“We target high-risk population and the data is year-marked. Unqualified doctors will be monitored and action will be taken against them. Fresh instructions to this effect have been issued on Wednesday,” said MPACS project direct Umesh Kumar. “Crackdown on quacks is a law and order problem. From the standpoint of the health department, only the chief health officer can recommend action to the district administration,” he added.However, the health department could not provide ready data on action initiated against quacks in 51 districts of MP. The number of HIV/AIDS patients in MP is 0.09% of the population — less than national adult prevalence of 0.27% (2013). In 2016, NACO reported 44,427 AIDS patients in MP.Quacks exploit the lacunae in healthcare in MP. The state has about 4,500 MBBS doctors for the health department whereas WHO estimates say there is a need for at least 15,000 more."

Infected syringe jabs and dialysis push 100 into HIV death jaws,2018-02-08,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Hyderabad News,Civic Issues","HYDERABAD: Contaminated syringes and blood products, blood transfusion and dialysis are inflicting scores of people with the dreaded HIV as they walk out hospitals, diagnostic labs and blood banks in Telangana.State health department officials said 72 people had contracted the virus in 2017, while 100 were afflicted with it in 2016 through reuse and exposure to contaminated syringes, blood transfusion and exposure to blood products.An official, however, privately admitted that the figures could be much more as several patients remain unaccounted due to poor screening methods as well as HIV infection through dialysis, which is not taken into account in state figures.“Patients, who undergo haemo dialysis, are highly vulnerable to hepatitis C, B and HIV, if adequate aseptic measures are not in place during dialysis. There is a high percentage of patients battling these deadly infections in the city,” pointed out Mujtaba Hasan Askari , president Helping Hand Foundation , an NGO which works with HIV patients.Recently, over 50 people were found to be infected with HIV in Unnao in Uttar Pradesh due to use of unsafe medical devices. Experts say mushrooming of blood banks, improper screening of blood and lack of checks were to be blamed for the spread of HIV.“The Telangana State Aids Control Society (TSACS) data may not reflect the true picture of new cases being infected through syringes and blood transfusion. Also, the fact that blood transfusion standards are not maintained as many private blood banks have mushroomed. Absence of checks, regulations and safety protocols make matters worse,” Askari pointed out.Interestingly, the latest and most-updated technology available to detect HIV, nucleic acid test (NAT), is not available in majority of the blood banks in the state.Currently, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test as well as manual screening is carried out in majority of blood banks in the state, but these test have their limitations.“For ELISA test to detect HIV, the virus should have been active for at least 40 days before the test. Also, the manual testing method (for ELISA third generation) has the possibility of the virus not getting detected at all due to human error. Though NAT is the safest (can detect the virus if it has been in the body for seven days), it is a costly affair,” T Vishnu Vardhan, chief executive officer, NTR Trust Blood Bank , said.Of 136 blood banks in the city, 43 facilities, including state-run blood banks, were being supported by National Aids Control Organization (NACO). And, less than five actually conduct NAT. NACO currently supplies the third generation manual ELISA kit to supported blood banks. “The ELISA test is followed by almost all government as well as private sector blood banks. While one possibility is that the basic antibody test that we are doing does not detect HIV as the antibody has not yet been developed, the possibility of erroneous blood banks, negligence and a small possibility of re-use of syringes cannot be ruled out,” Dr V Rajasekhar, project director, TSACS, said. “So far, no incident of blood banks totally avoiding blood screening has come to our notice,” he added.Also, once blood banks discover that a patient was HIV positive, they should inform, counsel and inform the TSACS and send the patient to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) in the district. “Usually, the blood banks do not take it to the logical end when they find a patient is positive, they tend to wash their hands off,” say insiders."

Less funds by government affecting AIDS prevention work: NGOs,2018-02-08,NAGPUR,"News,City News,Nagpur News","NAGPUR: City NGOs working towards AIDS prevention have said that limited funds from the government has hit their daily functioning. They said the money provided is insufficient to effectively run the organizations.The NGOs claimed that they have not received funds for a specific duration from November 2016 to March 2017 and add that none of the officials are looking into the issue. The workers have expressed displeasure over the attitude of the government towards social causes and are worried about their future.The issue concerns numerous city NGOs having a staff of around 400 contractual workers, who run more than 15 projects for Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). These projects are responsible for HIV awareness and prevention and also works for rehabilitation of HIV+ individuals.“The received money is enough just for the salaries of the workers. Any other extra activity or campaign is not covered in the funds making it very difficult to operate. The allotted sum does not cover miscellaneous expenses, thereby affecting the working,” said Amruta Joshi, joint secretary of Bhartiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh.Anand Chandrani, founder of Sarthi Trust , said, “Working without salaries for such a long time was already an issue and the limited amount has added to the woes. We are already working day in and day out to reach the needy and fight against the disease, but such acts demotivates the entire cause of working.”Rajabhau Jodh, project director of Manav Vikas Seva Sanstha , said that such fiascos hamper the personal lives of the workers. “A worker also has a family and has to look after his needs. With the salary being received after such a long time and also in such finite amount, the workers feel helpless.”Hemlata Lonave from Indian Red Cross Society said, “The money received is hardly sufficient for all the requirements of the organization. Moreover, after intimation from the officials to curtail the staff, almost 50% workers were laid off increasing the work significantly.”MSACS joint director Lokesh Gabhane, said, “We provide them appropriate funds, which are allotted to us by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). We try our best to give appropriate money so that it is sufficient for different activities of the NGOs. Though sometimes the funds might not be on par with their expectations, but it is not the case every time.”Talking about the backlog of salary between November 2016 and March 2017, Gabhane said talks are on with NACO officials and they will try to solve the issues immediately."
"Beggars dying on city streets, cold wave increasing fatalities",2017-12-23,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Hyderabad News","HYDERABAD: The cold has taken its toll in the city with 10 beggars dying on footpaths in November and five in December, including one at Nampally on Friday. The chill aggravated respiratory illness and whitener addiction is said to be a death trigger.In total, 13 unidentified people died on the streets in Hyderabad and 14 in November, including the beggars. Police registered FIRs in all cases and shifted the bodies to Gandhi and Osmania General Hospital mortuaries.The deaths occurred even as an anti-beggar drive is on and those found begging were being shifted to the rehabilitation centre at prisons department premises in Chanchalaguda and Cherlapally.Interestingly, the day on which US President’s advisor Ivanka Trump arrived in Hyderabad (November 28), a 75-year-old beggar died near Badi Masjid in Mallepally. Another labourer died of cold while he sleeping on the streets after work. Most deaths were reported after midnight till early morning in December when cold wave conditions prevailed. Analysis of FIRs registered by Hyderabad police reveals most cases were from Nampally, Gopalapuram, Abids Road, Kachiguda. Most victims were above 60 years of age.A police official said: “Deaths of aged persons from November last week and December on footpaths, particularly those found dead between midnight and 8am, are due to frostbite. Other deaths during the day could be due to other reasons, including consumption of whitener and illnesses.” Nampally police said, a 60-year-old beggar was found dead near Anees Ul Ghurba Orphanage footpath near Ek Minar at Nampally.Speaking to TOI, medico-legal consultant former professor & head of department of forensic medicine of Osmania Medical College Dr M Narayana Reddy said: “Beggars or the homeless sleeping in the open, particularly those suffering from respiratory diseases, will be stricken due to cold wave conditions. If they are not sleeping in warm conditions, illness will aggravate and they die. Usually, healthy people will not be affected due to cold wave. Autopsy of bodies cannot reveal cold as cause of death when they have illness too.”The state government said if beggars had not been rounded up, there would have been more deaths on roads. State Institute of Correctional Administration official M Sampat , who is leading the drive against beggars, said: “If not for the drive, there would be more deaths on streets. We are asking not only beggars, but also homeless to come voluntarily to our rehabilitation centre. We are providing blankets and rooms are warm. We have been providing hot water from mid-November. Since last five days, GHMC and traffic police have been handing us over at least 30 to 40 beggars. We have around 145 male beggars at Chanchalaguda now. In past two months, 470 beggars were brought here and of this we handed over 330 to family members. Only six are repeat beggars. On December 27, DG prisons will hold a conference and announce Rs 500 reward to those spotting beggars.”Sampat said: “We have a doctor visiting beggars in the home every day.

Puducherry stands first in country with zero prevalence of HIV,2017-12-30,PUDUCHERRY,"News,City News,Puducherry News","PUDUCHERRY: The Union territory of Puducherry has achieved zero prevalence of HIV and secured first place in HIV control and prevention among all other states and Union territories in the country, said director (health and family welfare services) K V Raman.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Raman said 800 pregnant women (as a representative of the general population) were tested randomly for HIV in Puducherry and none tested positive. Hence, the Union government officially announced that ‘Puducherry has zero prevalence in HIV and stands first among all other states and Union territories of India’. At present, the HIV prevalence in India is 0.28%.While prevalence is the actual number of cases with the disease during a period of time or at a particular date in time, incidence is the rate of new cases of the disease reported in a period of time e.g., per month or per year.The survey was a part of the Union government’s HIV sentinel surveillance conducted once in two years through the National Aids Control Organisation, New Delhi, in all the states and Union territories of India. In the previous 2014 HIV sentinel surveillance, Puducherry was placed 10th with a prevalence of 0.13%.Puducherry also stood first with least HIV prevalence of 0.2% in “the men having sex with men” (MSMs) among all states and Union territories. The prevalence in India is 2.69% among the MSMs. Puducherry was ranked fourth with a prevalence of 1.21% in the previous 2014 HIV sentinel surveillance.Puducherry was eighth in the country with HIV prevalence of 0.27% among the female sex workers. The prevalence in India is 1.56%. Puducherry was ranked 16th with a prevalence of 1.21% in the previous 2014 HIV sentinel surveillance."
Sex education? To teach or not is no more the question,2017-12-19,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News","CHENNAI: The Centre might have banned condom ads on television during daytime, but for children growing up in the internet era the ‘forbidden’ facts are available on their fingertips. But while information may be plenty, experts said not all that’s on the net is authentic and that it was crucial for schools to make sex education a part of the curriculum.A section of schools said rather than weaning children away from such ads, they should be properly educated on sex. “Sex education is almost non-existent in schools. There is no defined curriculum. Although biology classes include a portion of the basics, there is nothing updated in terms of the information provided,” said Vishnucharan P, correspondent of Shree Niketan Group of Schools. “Students come from different religious, cultural and economic backgrounds and teachers do not want to take the onus of delving into these topics as they are not sure of reactions they will get from different sections,” he said.Principal of MCC Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Chetpet, Revathy Bonns said other than the lessons included under biology, there was no proper sex education. “The concept of contraceptives is a topic touched upon in biology books but it doesn’t get into details. Children are very curious about these issues and they need to be made aware of them in the right way,” she said.Many students said they barely came across such topics in classes. Deepthi S, who passed Class XII exams this year, said there were no sex education classes during her school days. However, her school invited NGOs to carry out HIV campaigns during which they were told about sexually transmitted diseases and the measures to control them.Some teachers said sex education can be introduced even if the curriculum did not emphasize it. Meenakshi Ramesh, principal of Vael’s Billabong School, said while CBSE wanted schools to include sex education in the curriculum, it did not take off. “But as a biology teacher I could use my position to go beyond textbooks and sensitise students regarding safe practices and STDs,” she said. “Debating clubs could bring up topics on sex education and even computer teachers can talk about social media and warn children of its misuse,” she said.NSN Matriculation HSS, Chitlapakkam has introduced the basics of sex education as part of their ‘life skills’ class, especially for higher secondary students. The school counsellor addresses teen students while the younger children are shown videos to raise awareness on sexual harassment/abuse.“The children’s exposure levels are very different and it is meaningless and even outdated to ban ads on TV when there is so much access to content online,” said Chitra Prasad, correspondent of the school.With Tamil Nadu on the verge of re-launching its syllabus, sex education could very well be an issue to ponder over. Chairman of the curriculum framework committee S Anandakrishnan said sex education is still a topic under discussion and there has been no unanimity on it so far.“Whether this should be a part of the curriculum proper or be taught as part of the general education system is one primary aspect we have to consider. Other factors like the age group at which it can be brought in, whether in direct or indirect form of educating, the reactions of parents also have to be considered. These are the points we are mulling over but we may get more clarity with discussions that will follow over the course of the next month or so,” he said."

Gold: Designer gold nanoparticles could combat deadly viruses,2017-12-19,WASHINGTON,News,"WASHINGTON: Scientists have created designer gold anti-viral nanoparticles that can bind to a range of viruses - such as dengue and herpes - and prevent them from infecting cells.A few broad-spectrum drugs that prevent viral entry into healthy cells exist, but they usually need to be taken continuously to prevent infection, and resistance through viral mutation is a serious risk.Researchers from University of Illinois at Chicago in the US designed new anti-viral nanoparticles that bind to a range of viruses, including herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and Dengue and Lentiviruses.Once injected in the body, these nanoparticles imitate human cells and ""trick"" the viruses.When the viruses bind to them - in order to infect them - the nanoparticles use pressure produced locally by this link- up to ""break"" the viruses, rendering them innocuous.Unlike other broad-spectrum antivirals, which simply prevent viruses from infecting cells, the new nanoparticles destroy viruses.The new nanoparticles mimic a cell surface protein called heparin sulfate proteoglycan ( HSPG ). A significant portion of viruses, including HIV, enter and infect healthy cells by first binding to HSPGs on the cell surface.Existing drugs that mimic HSPG bind to the virus and prevent it from binding to cells, but the strength of the bond is relatively weak.These drugs also can not destroy viruses, and the viruses can become reactivated when the drug concentration is decreased.Researchers sought to design a new anti-viral nanoparticle based on HSPG, but one that would bind more tightly to viral particles and destroy them at the same time.""We knew the general composition of the HSPG-binding viral domains the nanoparticles should bind to, and the structures of the nanoparticles, but we did not understand why different nanoparticles behave so differently in terms of both binding strength and preventing viral entry into cells,"" said Petr Kral , from UIC Through elaborate simulations, researchers helped solve these issues and guided the experimentalists in tweaking the nanoparticle design so that they worked better.The researchers used advanced computational modeling techniques to generate precise structures of various target viruses and nanoparticles down to the location of each atom.The team's anti-viral nanoparticle could bind irreversibly to a range of viruses, and caused lethal deformations to the viruses, but had no effect on healthy tissues or cells.In vitro experiments with the nanoparticles showed that they bound irreversibly to the herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, syncytial virus, dengue virus and Lentivirus.""We were able to provide the data needed to the design team so that they could develop a prototype of what we hope will be a very effective and safe broad-spectrum anti-viral that can be used to save lives,"" said Kral."

Condoms can prevent the spread of HIV, Gonorrhea, Chlamydia , Trichomoniasis, Herpes, Syphilis, Chancroid. Using a condom can also reduce the risk of cancer from HPV (genital warts) and protects from getting an STD."" While efforts are made to popularize usage of condoms as the best means of dual protection the advisory comes as a dampener, it said.Prateek Kasliwal, counsel for the petitioner argued that Rule 7 (7) of The Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994 stipulates that “No advertisement which endangers the safety of children or creates in them any interest in unhealthy practices or shows them begging or in an undignified or indecent manner shall not be carried in the cable service.”He said if there is any violation of these rules there is a mechanism to proceed against the violators. ""Even assuming for the sake of argument that the advertisement of condom is violative of Rule 7(7), 7(8) then how can the advertisement from the time beyond 10 pm to 6 am is non-violative, he asked . Therefore he argued that the very advisory is absurd and has been issued without application of mind.The petition also said that such action is against the interest of public at large and vindicates the hypocritical approach, wherein Government in one hand promoting family planning, awareness about AIDS and STD and contrary to their stand on the other hand it is obstructing dissemination of Condom advertisement which are crucial for family planning, decreasing abortion deaths, awareness about HIV-AIDS and STD."
EU: Threat of EU states holding up drugs in transit recedes,2017-12-20,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: In a victory for India and the developing world, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has dropped the idea of constituting a working group to study circumstances that could justify a country seizing medicines passing through its port even if the medicines were meant for some other country.The WHO secretariat had prepared a discussion document outlining criteria that could justify a country’s customs authorities intervening to check medicines passing through their ports on the grounds of public health concerns. This set off alarm bells among Indian pharmaceutical companies that export medicines and among countries like Brazil, which import them from India. With the past experience of European countries seizing Indian drugs meant for Latin American countries transiting through their territory, it was feared that the new criteria were an attempt to legitimise such practices.The discussion group in the WHO was supposed to bring in “prioritised activity” on the issue of seizure of medicines in transit on grounds of public health concerns. This was seen as an attempt to force the formation of a working group that would identify circumstances or situations in which the transit country could intervene.At a recent meeting in Geneva on the issue, the Indian delegation argued forcefully that if the exporting and importing countries did not have a problem, the transit country ought not to interfere. India was supported by many others including Brazil, Egypt and Iran.In 2008, several consignments of medicines had been seized by customs authorities at European ports on the basis of intellectual property violations and in the process several consignments of HIV medicines and vaccines were delayed.At the two recent Geneva meetings of the steering committee and the member state mechanism, they were trying to establish that customs authorities in transit countries had suo motu powers to intervene, explained an expert on international trade. No such power exists under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a multilateral agreement to promote international trade, though such powers exist in European regulation.With India and several other countries contending strongly that no such suo motu power existed, it was agreed to drop the making of a working group."

The multi-pronged strategy adopted by the government and increased surveillance has helped bring down the numbers and detect more cases. By the end of this year, a total of 70,000 people will have been tested for HIV, D’Sa said.No sooner it is discovered that a mother is HIV positive, she is immediately put on treatment, and this has greatly helped halt the transmission from mother to child, this drastically bringing down the number of cases.Goa was the first sate in the country to introduce a legislation for screening of blood at the blood bank, D'Sa said.There are facilities available at all primary health care centres to ensure pregnant mothers are screened for HIV, D'Sa said. Goa Medical College (GMC) also has two CD4 testing machines where HIV positive people can get their immunity tested.The anti-retrieval therapy centre at GMC has also been recognised for providing first and second line of treatment.

The number has come down to 0.03 %,” Dr S M Manivannan , district program manager (DPM) of district AIDS prevent and control unit ( DAPCU ), told TOI on Saturday.He also said that out of 100 children born to HIV infected mothers, 30% to 35% were infected till 2013. “The chances of mother to children transmission declined after we started prescribing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to pregnant mothers also. We gradually brought the number from 10% to 4% and now reached 2%. The mission is to achieve 0% mother to children transmission,” said Dr Manivannan.In Trichy district, a total of 1 23,381 people underwent HIV tests in 2016-17. The tests revealed that 640 were infected by HIV. District AIDS prevention control unit said that the number of HIV infection dropped to 0.5 % from 0.7% in 2015-16.The statistics showed a declining trend about HIV infection in Trichy and that the number of HIV infection diagnosed through integrated counselling and testing centre ( ICTC ) was 0.82 % in 2014-15. The number of HIV infected patients which was high in 2008 and 2009 gradually declined, claimed DAPCU officials.The downward trend was attributed to awareness among people about safety measures such as condoms.“The single most important occupation affected by the HIV remains the driver profession. Previously, long distance drivers were vulnerable to HIV infection because of their long separation from their wives and the prevalence of female sex workers. Now, all kinds of drivers have come in the vulnerable group,” said Manivannan.Around 11,000 people were undergoing HIV screening test in all the 33 ICTC in Trichy every month. Not all of them were coming on suspicion of HIV infection, several of them with chronic illness and tuberculosis were referred by doctors for HIV screening. Pre-surgical screening of patients and pregnant women also added up to the total number."
‘HIV infection leads to many brain infections’,2017-12-03,Nagpur,,"Nagpur: HIV infection is known to bring many other infections along with it. In South Africa it is increasingly leading to brain infections. Doctors claimed that HIV/AIDS is also increasing the incidence of strokes and epilepsy.Dr John Ouma, of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, told TOI that though the commonest of infection that comes with HIV is tuberculosis, HIV infection and seizures were also related.“Hence, epilepsy was a common disease. One in hundred persons suffers from epilepsy at some point of time in life. In fact, Neuro-AIDS is a commonly used word in South Africa and neuro-cognitive disorders caused due AIDS are a topic of research,” he said.Dr Ouma is in the city for the five-day annual conference of the Neurological Society of India being hosted by the Nagpur Neuro Society.Dr Ouma said that Africa had a very small number of neurologists and neurosurgeons. Hence, a large number of the patients from Africa come to India for treatment.“India has a majority of the advanced equipment and innovation in the field. The treatment here is available at less than one fourth the cost of the developed countries. Hence a lot of medical tourism happens between India and South Africa,” he said.Medical tourism, Dr Ouma said, was possible also due to the liberal policies of the Indian government unlike the USA which asks for “cumbersome paper work”.Dr Ouma said that despite all the developments in the brain sciences, man seems to have understood less than 5% of the functioning of the brain. “There is so much of scope for research in neurosciences, neurobiology, neuropathology etc that amazing work can be done by neurologists and neurosurgeons in future when they understand the brain more,” he said."
New way to stop HIV in its tracks found,2017-12-04,WASHINGTON,News,"WASHINGTON: Researchers have discovered the protein that helps HIV to evade the body's defence system, an advance that may help stop the deadly virus in its tracks. When HIV-1 infects an immune cell, the virus travels to the nucleus so quickly there is not enough time to set off the cell's alarm system.Now, researchers at Loyola University Chicago in the US have discovered the protein that helps the virus travel so fast. The researchers found that without this protein, the virus became stranded in the cytoplasm, where it was detected by the viral defence system.""By preventing its normal movement, we essentially turned HIV-1 into a sitting duck for cellular sensors,"" said Edward M Campbell , an associate professor at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. HIV-1 infects and kills immune system cells, including T cells and macrophages that were used in the study.This cripples the immune system, making the patient vulnerable to common bacteria, viruses and other pathogens that are usually harmless in people with healthy immune systems.After HIV-1 enters a cell, it has to work its way through the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, HIV-1 takes control of the cell and makes additional HIV-1 copies. However, getting through the cytoplasm is not easy. Cytoplasm consists of fluid that is thick with proteins and structures such as mitochondria.""Something the size of a virus cannot just diffuse through the cytoplasm,"" said Campbell, corresponding author of the study published in the journal PNAS . ""It would be like trying to float to the bathroom in a very crowded bar. You need to have a plan,"" said Campbell.HIV-1 is able to get to the nucleus quickly via tubular tracks called microtubules. The virus attaches itself to a molecular motor called dynein, which moves down the microtubule like a train car on tracks.Campbell and colleagues discovered the ""ticket"" HIV-1 needs to get on the train - a protein called bicaudal D2. HIV-1 binds to bicaudal D2, which recruits the dynein molecular motor. The dynein then transports HIV-1 towards the nucleus.The finding raises the possibility of developing a drug that would prevent HIV-1 from binding to bicaudal D2, thus stranding the virus in the cytoplasm. This would not only prevent infection but also give the cell time to turn on antiviral genes that would protect it and neighbouring cells from infection."

"‘Denied treatment’, HIV+ man goes on hunger strike",2017-12-06,LUDHIANA,,"LUDHIANA: A 22-year-old HIV-positive youth went on a hunger strike at civil hospital on Tuesday morning after being “denied treatment for five days”. Soon, other HIV-positive patients, too, joined him to protest against the hospital staff.Talking to the TOI, the youth said, “I had recently got an implant in my left leg, which was giving some trouble. When I went to Dr Davinder, orthopaedic surgeon of civil hospital, he refused to admit and treat me. He asked me to go back to my hometown in UP from where I got the implant.”Dr US Sooch, district programme officer, HIV/ Aids prevention , said, “The patient came to me with a complaint and I told Dr Davinder to admit him. The patient also gave a complaint to Dr Meenu Singh , deputy director, Punjab State Aids Control Society. But he was not admitted.”“It was only after I went on a hunger strike and an NGO, Dr Kotinis, offered help that the hospital admitted me,” the youth added. Dr Inderjit from NGO Dr Kotinis said, “The HIV-positive patient has been complaining for the past five days that he is being denied treatment. Left with no option, he went on a hunger strike and didn’t even take his HIV medicine. Then, the senior medical officer came and the patient was admitted. Many other HIV patients joined him in his protest and complained about doctors and nurses’ misbehaviour.”The protest, which started at 10am, was called off at 2pm. While refuting the allegations, senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Kulwinder Singh said, “Dr Davinder gave him antibiotics for five days, and he was asked to come for further treatment after the dose. We had asked the patient for his medical records. As he could not give the records, he was asked to take treatment from the doctor who did the implant.“He was never denied treatment. Every day so many HIV and hepatitis-C patients are treated, why will he be denied treatment? Moreover, he was checked in OPD and given antibiotics . But the patient wanted to be admitted, but we can’t do that unnecessarily.”"

HIV directly impacts brain in early stages: Study,2017-12-01,JOHANNESBURG,News,"JOHANNESBURG: Human immunodeficiency virus HIV ) directly impacts the brain in the early stages of the infection, according to a study.It has long been known that many people with HIV also experience negative cognitive symptoms, such as depression and forgetfulness, researchers said.However, it was unclear whether it was caused by such patients' physical illness, or whether the virus had a direct effect on the brain, they said.""Our research shows that HIV does have an impact on the brain and that these low-grade cognitive symptoms are likely not just function loss due to patients feeling sick, tired or depressed,"" said Stefan du Plessis, from Stellenbosch University (SU) in South Africa.Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique, researchers compared the brain activity of people with HIV to those without HIV while they performed certain tasks designed to stimulate specific regions of the brain.HIV-positive study participants were in good physical and mental health, did not abuse drugs, and had not yet started on antiretroviral treatment (ART).The researchers found that these participants had a decreased blood flow in the striatal region of the brain while performing tasks involving higher motor functions.They also observed little action and blood flow to the nucleus accumbens of HIV-positive patients while performing a task involving a monetary reward.This section of the brain is involved with aspects concerning motivation, apathy and enthusiasm for life.""The fMRI scans show how the HI virus affects important parts of the brain involved with motivation,"" said Du Plessis, lead author of the research published in the journal AIDS ""We theorise that this could happen to such an extent that patients are often simply not motivated enough to take their medication, or even get out of bed,"" he said."

Government’s treat-all policy not an instant hit with HIV patients,2017-12-02,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: In the last six months, over 25,000 people living with HIV, including 9,400 from the state, have been added to the national programme under the treat-all policy . The process of initiating every HIV positive individual on antiretroviral treatment (ART), however, has been fraught with difficulties ranging from refusals and adherence issues to side-effects.In Maharashtra, around 33,500 people were identified in the pre-ART category that includes those who are positive but not in immediate need of medicines due to good immunity levels . Out of that, the state has managed to contact around 21,000 people and initiate less than half on treatment. Earlier, ART would be given only after the CD4 levels dropped to 500.“Those with higher immunity levels are reluctant to take medicines daily on the ground that they do not suffer from any symptoms. We are reaching out to them through our social workers and NGOs,” said Parimal Singh , project director of Maharashtra District Aids Control Society (MSACS). The WHO had recommended the treat-all policy so that people living with HIV could lead healthier lives and cut down transmissibility.The Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) has been facing similar issues. Around 1,400 patients from the city have been added under the treat-all policy. “Adherence is a problem that we are trying to tackle. Under the treat-all policy, even those with higher CD4 levels are started on treatment. Some of them have stopped treatment after suffering side-effects. Their contention being they were healthier before starting ART,” said Dr Shrikala Acharya, assistant project director of MDACS. “However, to prevent problems of drug resistance, we have started rigorous counselling before initiation of treatment,” she said.Meanwhile, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) administrator Mark Green, while speaking at an event on Friday, said, “New HIV infections in India have reduced by 66% since 2000. Today, nearly one million people are on ART and that is an extraordinary achievement you should celebrate.” He added the body would continue to provide financial support and technical expertise to the programme.(Inputs by Rajdeep Sinha)"
"459 HIV patients, 10 deaths but no therapy centre in city",2017-12-02,NOIDA,"News,City News,Noida News","NOIDA: While the number of HIV-infected patients in Gautam Budh Nagar has reached 459 in 2017 and as many as 10 deaths from AIDS reported in the past five years, the district still lacks an antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre.Patients who go to neighbouring Ghaziabad for ART treatment say all the sampling facilities are not available there. An ART facility in GB Nagar district hospital in Sector 30 was closed in 2014 after a centre was opened in Ghaziabad’s MMG Hospital. ART is an effective treatment of HIV patients which slows down the rate of the virus copying itself, using a combination of several anti-retroviral medicines.Absence of all sampling facilities and only one designated day in a week for screening at MMG Hospital, patients from GB Nagar often go to Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital (LBSH) in Delhi.“We do not have too many HIV patients in the district and since, Ghaziabad is the nearest district, it was considered that it can cater to the neighbouring districts of Gautam Budh Nagar and Hapur too. In case, the patients feel that the facility in the neighbouring district requires to be enhanced, we will write to the state government through the senior officials about it,” said additional chief medical officer Shireesh Jain.According to India HIV/AIDS Alliance, which is working on two projects, including Wajood and Samarth, to help the LGBT community in NCR fight with the high prevalence of the infection, it has identified as many as 36 people from the community infected with HIV at their own screening centre.“We have screened as many as 36 HIV patients from our community after which they underwent a test at the integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC) of the district hospital in Sector 30. However, they require as many as 11 more tests till their ART treatment is prescribed by a doctor,” Deepak Kumar, chief manager (UP and NCR), Samarth, told TOI.“For the crucial CD4 count (test for measuring the CD4 cells in the blood) on which the number of medicines provided under the ART treatment depends, is available at the MMG Hospital once a week. However, patients are not ready to go to Ghaziabad due to the distance, they usually prefer to go to Delhi,” he said.When contacted, Dr JK Tyagi , chief medical superintendent, MMG Hospital, said while the hospital has staff to see around 400 patients, they have around 1,300 patients undergoing treatment at the centre.“We have written to the state government multiple times to increase the staff strength so that the number of days for examination be increased,” he said."
Drug de-addiction course now via distance education,2017-12-02,PATIALA,"News,City News,Chandigarh News,Civic Issues","PATIALA: Amidst a lot of hue and cry over the rise in drug abuse among the adolescents in Punjab, the Punjabi University is all set to come up with a course on drug de-addiction , which will be first of its kind in the region. The one-year post-graduate diploma will be provided through distance education. This would not only generate employment opportunities but also provide students with certificates.After approving its plan of the course, the Punjabi University had sent a proposal for approval to University Grant Commission (UGC). Once approved by the UGC, the course will train students on the subject of de-addiction. The syllabus and module of the course have been prepared while an outline for the structure of the training to be given under the course has also been drawn.The university had already taken an initiative by giving training to university students to warn adolescents about the harmful effects of drugs. The state government is also taking initiatives in this regard by making peer groups of the students to get information of the supply chain and also educate the youth from the young members of peer groups to avoid drugs consumption.The students in the course would be trained by psychiatrists, doctors, social workers, professors and other scholars. The students would also have job opportunities and can be recruited as counsellors and others staff needed at de-addiction centres.“We are planning a course on de-addiction through distance education and this is being done on the instructions of Centre government. This could prove beneficial in the upcoming future for the students.”Earlier the course was available at Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU). A special distance education program on PG diploma in HIV-AIDS is already being imparted to students since 2010 by Punjabi University. Under this course, every year around 25 students are enrolled and given training. It is learnt that a number of these diploma holders have been placed in ICTC programs run by the government or in private institutes. The training to students is being imparted by social workers, psychologists, and doctors under HIV -AIDS diploma."

BENGALURU","News,City News,Bengaluru News,Civic Issues","TIMES VIEW While it’s heartening that more transgenders are coming forward in large numbers to register themselves in electoral rolls, it’s still a long way before the entire community feels comfortable about openly declaring their gender identity. From being termed as the Others until a few years ago to be officially known as Transgenders now is a big change. While government’s measures have made things better for transgenders, a lot more needs to be done. And only when the community feels its members won’t face discrimination will they be reassured that there’s no danger in coming out

BENGALURU: The recent draft electoral rolls have brought cheer to sexual minorities in Karnataka : 4,340 voters have registered as transgenders, up from 2,125 voters in the 2013 assembly elections.This is in addition to most sexual minorities who would have identified themselves as a woman or man. According to the data with the Sexual Minorities Forum , at least 50,000 transgenders are covered under HIV prevention schemes in Karnataka. Transgenders used to register themselves as ‘others’ earlier. This was replaced by ‘transgenders’ recently.The 'others' category was recently replaced by ‘transgenders’, and this classification includes Jogappas, Kothis, female-to-male transgenders, male-to-female transgenders and Mangalamukhis.Activists, though, are not buoyed by the jump in number of voters identifying themselves as transgenders. “The number of transgender voters does not account for even 10% of the population. Many transgenders identify themselves as femaleor malein their voter ID cards to be eligible for welfare schemes,” said Mallappa S Kumbar , state coordinator of theforum.Manohar Elavarthy, founder, Sangama , which has been fighting for the rightsof sexual minorities, suspects the spike in the number of transgenders could be a data error, given that electoral rolls are teeming with errors. “The number of transgenders in the electoral rolls is not indicative of the population. There are at least 10,000 transgenders in the state and the number could well be 50,000. It would be interesting to know who are these4,340transgender voters,” Elavarthy said.Only 49 of 2,125 voters who had registered under the ‘others’ category voted in the 2013 assembly polls. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, 160 of 3,957 voters registered under ‘others’ category had voted.Nisha Gulur, advocacy officer, Sangama, said the poor voting percentage explains the stigma and discrimination faced by the community. “Transgenders are not sure in which queue to stand while waiting to cast their vote. The numbers may have increased, as many have Aadhaar numbers now. While standing in the queue, there are chances of facing discrimination and hence many shy away from the voting exercise,” she said."
Underprivileged children in Mumbai: The Korean ‘athithi’ who stayed back to educate kids in Mumbai,2017-12-14,"We’ve often heard about stories of how a single experience can be a life-changing one. It’s even more intense when a person goes to a foreign land and makes it his or her own. The reasons could be anything — from helping the needy to imparting education. The last is what made Sookja Kong Bangera , a Korean national, stay back in India, while on a visit in 1992.Throwing in a Hindi word now and then, she narrates about the time she accompanied her now husband, Suraj Bangera, when he visited slums and red light areas to organise free health camps. “I went along with him and saw the plight of the children there. They were so beautiful and precious!” she recalls. The former banker couldn’t sit quietly after this experience and started the school. She says she was moved to tears when she saw the remarkable change education brought into the children’s lives.Her school, since it was established in 1996, has completed 21 years. A humble building in a locality of Navi Mumbai, it stands out as an unorthodox place for learning. A leveller of sorts, children from affluent families rub shoulders with sex workers’ children here. And those who can’t pay the fees, are never singled out.For Gayatri Bale (name changed), a former brothel madam and a grandmother to two orphaned children, Bangera is an angel. Her daughter-in-law and son died of HIV, leaving her with the responsibility of their kids. She recalls how no school would admit the children because of the locality they lived in.“Their lives have changed in ways I could never imagine were possible,” she says, describing the transformation in her elder grandson Akshit’s (name changed) life.

It’s even more intense when a person goes to a foreign land and makes it his or her own. The reasons could be anything — from helping the needy to imparting education. The last is what made Sookja Kong Bangera , a Korean national, stay back in India, while on a visit in 1992.Throwing in a Hindi word now and then, she narrates about the time she accompanied her now husband, Suraj Bangera, when he visited slums and red light areas to organise free health camps. “I went along with him and saw the plight of the children there. They were so beautiful and precious!” she recalls. The former banker couldn’t sit quietly after this experience and started the school. She says she was moved to tears when she saw the remarkable change education brought into the children’s lives.Her school, since it was established in 1996, has completed 21 years. A humble building in a locality of Navi Mumbai, it stands out as an unorthodox place for learning. A leveller of sorts, children from affluent families rub shoulders with sex workers’ children here. And those who can’t pay the fees, are never singled out.For Gayatri Bale (name changed), a former brothel madam and a grandmother to two orphaned children, Bangera is an angel. Her daughter-in-law and son died of HIV, leaving her with the responsibility of their kids. She recalls how no school would admit the children because of the locality they lived in.“Their lives have changed in ways I could never imagine were possible,” she says, describing the transformation in her elder grandson Akshit’s (name changed) life.

Thane tops the chart in HIV positive cases in district,2017-12-01,THANE,"News,City News,Thane News","THANE: Residents from Thane have been affected the most with the killer HIV virus. Out of 2,304 HIV positive patients in the district, around 33% were from Thane city, including Mira Road and Bhayander. This was stated in the 2016-17 report of Thane’s District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU). However, there has been a drop in the number of cases in the entire district.The officials claimed that Thane city, comprising of Thane, Mira Road and Bhayander, had more people who belong to the high risk population. Navi Mumbai and Bhiwandi were among the top three places in the district that were detected with the most number of cases.“These cities not only have a high population, but also have people from the high risk zone —like sex workers, migrants, transgenders, truck drivers, etc. It was also seen that out of the ones who were detected positive, 80% got infected due to unsafe sex. While others got it through blood transfusion. Though 110 pregnant women were detected HIV positive in 2016-17, the number has decreased as compared to the 2015-16 figures that stood at 153 women affected with the virus. This drop is because of the awareness drives being carried out by various organisations,” said Ratan Gadhave, district programme officer of theDAPCU.The department, along with 33 NGOs, conduct awareness drives on regular basis and focus more on the people belonging to the high risk communities.“Out of those who fall under the high risk category, the highest number of people tested positive were migrant workers and and truck drivers. But there has been a rise in the number of patients taking the HIV test. This is because of the awareness drives we have been carrying out in these pockets. During these drives, we request those infected with the virus to come to the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre for tests,” said Gadhave.However, there has been a drop in HIV positive cases in the district. This is an indication that the awareness drives and sensitization programmes organized by the state authorities and voluntary groups in the last seven years has shown positive results. While there were 5,154 HIV cases in 2010-11, the numbers came down to around 2,304 in 2016-2017."

The state ranks eighth in the country in HIV prevalence.According to experts, the alarming number of deaths could be because of restrictions put by the government on free antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with the deadly disease. Of the 80,173 people who died of the disease, only 60,208 were provided antiretroviral therapy by the government, while the rest 19,965 were left out as they were not deemed eligible for the treatment.“How come this data is not available on the website? Peer educators, who spread the prevention message among sex workers and play a crucial role, have not been paid honorarium for many months. Unless the state government wakes up and reaches out to the last person, its efforts to cut down on fresh HIV cases won’t yield results,” said David Bodapatti , public health activist who has been working with the affected community.KSAPS authorities claimed that the state has taken considerable steps to reduce the number of HIV cases. “In prevention of mother-to- child transmission, the state has taken preventive measures. Every pregnant woman is tested for HIV, and if found positive is immediately provided antiretroviral therapy. The number of children tested HIV positive at the age of 18 months was 43 in 2014-15, and has come down to 31 in 2017-18. The mother-to-child transmission rate has come down to less than 5%,” officials said."

And it’s a positive sign as until a few years ago, the infection rate from mother-to-child was 25% across the country.

CD4 cells fight infections, but the HIV virus kills them.Medical experts at the ART centre said, if diagnosed and treated early with proper ART, HIV-positive patients can live for over 30 years.For the convenience of patients, the health department has started four ART Link centres in Manmad, Chandwad, Yeola and Niphad.Health officials said over the years there has been a dip in the number of patients registered as HIV positive."

But, I rarely visit them. The centre is my home now,” she says.The centre run by the Yash Foundation in Nashik near Gangapur Naka, has nine women residents busy in stitching handbags and gloves.

Its difficult to convince people in Nashik, Pune and Mumbai to buy the bags and gloves made by the HIV positive women.”“People think twice before buying the products made by these women. We can’t even think of entering the food-processing industry as it will be impossible to convince people to buy products made by HIV positive women,” Patil said.“Instead of participating in AIDS awareness rally for one day on December 1, it would be better if people accept us as a part of society.

"Soon, test to measure amount of HIV virus in patients’ blood",2017-12-01,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: Following years of protest, the Centre is set to roll out the viral load-testing for HIV/AIDS patients in the next six months across the country. The test essentially tells whether the treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of HIV virus in a patient’s blood.The National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has already shortlisted laboratories across the country that would be scaled up to carry out the tests. However, it may be a while before every patient on antiretroviral therapy (ART) qualifies to undergo the expensive test, which costs between Rs 6,000 and Rs 8,000 in a private laboratory.In 2013, the WHO had recommended the viral load-test be carried out within six months of starting an individual on ART and be repeated at the end of that year. Subsequently, it should be carried out annually. People living with HIV and NGOs have since been fighting for the test to be made routinely available and more accessible.“From February onward, 532 ART centres across the country will have the viral load-testing facility. In the initial phases, it will be offered to children below the age of five years, people taking treatment for five years and those suffering from HIV-TB co-infection. They have been chosen keeping the criticality of their condition in mind. The test will subsequently be available to all 1.2 million people on ART treatment in the country,” said Dr R S Gupta of NACO’s Care, Support and Treatment division. The civic-run KEM and Nair hospitals are likely to be the centres in the city.Currently, the test is selectively offered at the state-run JJ Hospital, where patients have to go through the stringent scrutiny of a committee.“The body takes between four and six months only to decide who will undergo the test. It’s unfortunate that in the absence of a viral load-test, the programme solely relies on CD4 count,” said Ganesh Acharya, a member of the Mumbai Aids Forum (MAF). CD4 is an indicator of the body’s immune system. “But it’s only part information about what the virus is doing with the immune system. A high viral load in the body will usually, but not always, mean a low CD4 count,” said infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who recommends viral load-testing every six months to one year.“Because of the unavailability of the test, patients also often don’t realize when they have become resistant to the first line or second line drugs,” said Poonam Patkar, secretary of MAF.Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) India that offers viral load-testing to KEM patients as a special model, run in collaboration with the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), said they have got great results in picking treatment failures early and improving outcomes by addressing non-adherence in patients. The MSF data collated from KEM has shown that 90% of the patients were responding to the treatment offered under the national programme as their viral loads were suppressed."
Adolescents with HIV will now have a reason to smile,2017-12-01,PANAJI,"News,City News,Goa News","PANAJI: In a unique attempt to provide a support system to adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV), a club dedicated to them will be set up at Agasaim , on Friday. Bloom and Blossom, as the group will be called, will aim at giving such adolescents a safe space while also ensuring that their health is optimised. It has been conceptualised by Peter Borges , founder and CEO of the NGO, Human Touch “This club will help young people allocate time to tend to their emotional needs at a critical juncture in their life, where establishing peer relationships is particularly important. Unlike other teenagers, there is a heightened risk among HIV+ adolescents to feel excluded and isolated. They are at a far greater risk of not seeking treatment, or dropping out once treatment begins,” Borges says.There are around 310 children known to be living with HIV in the state, of which around 200 belong to the adolescent age group (10-19 years). A majority live with their families, sometimes with single parents and extended families. There are also a substantial number of orphans, close to 40 of whom are housed in three institutions in Tivim, Cavelossim and Rivona.Although ALHIV still face great difficulties in having their voices heard, they also have the potential to be powerful agents of change. Bloom and Blossom, which will conduct its meetings in the Human Touch office at Agasaim, could be a good place to start.“They will better placed to advocate issues that concern them and should be given opportunities for engagement in policy-making, too. In recent years, discussions on the health such youngsters have taken centrestage at many national and international forums. There is also a demand for a revitalized community-wide response to support them,” Borges says.“Adequate treatment, literacy and the right to make decisions about one’s own health are central to empowering ALHIV to be able to engage in decisions about their own care. Finding innovative ways to establish youth as actors in their own treatment would have onward benefits, as they gain confidence navigating healthcare systems. It would also promote adherence and retention,” Borges adds."

The KGMU study puts the state higher than the national average of 2.6 per 1,000 people.The KGMU study is based on data of regular check-up of blood donors compiled over a period of four years. KGMU is one of the few centers in India that use Nucleic Acid Test (NAT), a WHO recommended gold standard for screening of blood samples and early detection of HIV, especially among infants.“The usual HIV testing is done using Elisa (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test which is inferior to NAT. This means that several cases of HIV which may not be detected by Elisa are detected by NAT. Also, NAT can detect HIV in a person almost six months earlier than ELISA,” said Prof Tulika Chandra , head of transfusion in medicine department, KGMU.But NAT is yet to be adopted by the department of health and family welfare and state health department."
Goa positive about drop in HIV cases,2017-12-01,"With one more month to year-end, Goa is optimistic that 2017 will reveal a decline in the number of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) cases compared to last year.

State payout for child sexual abuse survivors to be gender-neutral,2017-12-01,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News,Crime News","MUMBAI: In a first, Maharashtra’s scheme for compensation for rape survivors will treat survivors of child sexual abuse in a gender-neutral manner—both boys and girls who have faced sexual assault will receive financial assistance.“It is hereby specifically clarified that this aspect of the Manodhairya scheme (for compensation to survivors of child sexual abuse) is gender-neutral and will apply equally to all the survivors irrespective of their sex,” says the scheme formulated by a committee comprising Justice Mridula Bhatkar, Justice Girish Kulkarni , advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni and the principal secretary, women and child welfare department. A division bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice Mahesh Sonak on Thursday gave its nod to the scheme and directed the state government to notify it within a month so that it can be implemented across Maharashtra The scheme envisages compensation between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 10 lakh for rape and acid attack survivors.“Every year, the women and child welfare department will allocate a sum of Rs 75 crore for the scheme,” said Kumbhakoni.As per the scheme, cases of gangrape where the victim has suffered grievous injury and incidents where the woman who has been raped incurs permanent physical or mental disability will be provided with a compensation of up to Rs 10 lakh. Similarly, in cases where a woman has been raped and murdered, her legal heirs will be provided compensation of up to Rs 10 lakh. In all other cases of rape, the financial assistance will be up to Rs 3 lakh.Where the victim of sexual assault is a minor boy or girl who suffers permanent disability or is mentally traumatized, monetary help of up to Rs 10 lakh will be provided.

Victims of acid attacks will also be eligible for financial help of between R s3 lakh and Rs 10 lakh depending on the severity of the case. The state legal services authority will decide the claims and disburse the compensation amount. The scheme also has a provision to recover the amount from victims if they turn hostile during trial and do not support the prosecution case. The authority has also been empowered to disburse Rs 30,000 as immediate relief to the victim within seven days.The committee has recommended that the state should set up at least one specially trained trauma team in every district to provide victims with “appropriate emotional support, guidance, medical help and psychiatric counselling free of cost.” If the victim woman or child contracts HIV due to the incident, the government will provide them treatment free of cost. “All victims shall be treated in all government, semi-government, corporation or municipal hospital and medical centres, with utmost priority and completely free of cost,” the report stated."
42% drop in new HIV positive cases in state in 7 years,2017-12-01,Nagpur,"News,City News,Nagpur News","Nagpur: In the last seven years, the rate of new HIV-positive cases in the state has declined by about 42%. As far as mortality due to HIV is concerned, it has declined threefold in last 13 years.The facts were revealed by Dr Pramod Deoraj, an official from Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) on the occasion of World AIDS Day that falls on December 1.Deoraj said, “The high rates of positive cases and deaths in the past were because earlier we had fewer ART centres, less medicine stock and not every HIV positive patient received free drugs from government due to criteria called CD4.”An official notification on May 5 this year made it possible to “treat all” living with HIV regardless of their CD4 cell count (a test that measures the strength of one’s immune system). It has further contributed to decline of new cases.Deoraj said, “Within the state there were about 23,000 HIV+ve patients who couldn’t get the treatment because of this criteria. With the new guidelines, the government has CD4 clause and we are having a good start. In the last six months we have reached out to over 15,000 patients through ART centres and have been able to begin treatment of about 8000.”Deoraj said, “In 2010, we used to record about 52,000 new HIV positive cases every year. Last year, the figure fell to 22,000. We have observed that the number is falling by about 1000 to 1200 every year. In 2004 the death rate for HIV positive patients used to be 15% and that has fallen to 5% now.”The state government has total 73 antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres where free drugs are given. Three centres in Nagpur district are in the medicine department of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH) and another at a public health facility in Kamptee.Officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) Tanuja Fale said, “In the district, we also have 21 Integrated Counselling and Testing Center (ICTC) where patients are tested for HIV, counselled and connected with ARTs. In 2015, the district received a mobile van to perform as ICTC in remote areas. Last year, we received another van from the collector.”An RTI query by activist Abhay Kolarkar revealed the ART record of GMCH between the year 2014 and 2016. There is a consistent decline in positive cases here too. The number of deaths came drastically down from 50 to 15 in 2015 but again rose to 30 in 2016."
"Doctors delaying treatment to HIV patients, claims NGO",2017-12-01,Mysuru,"News,City News,Mysore News","Mysuru: ‘Right to Health’ is the theme for the 2017 World Aids Day , which falls on December 1. However, some people living with HIV in Mysuru feel stigmatized as people in the medical profession themselves are looking at them as ‘aliens’ by delaying treatment.Sources in Ananda Jyothi Positive Network, an organization of positive people working for the welfare of community members, claimed that doctors are avoiding treating HIV patients. They claim to have come across two cases wherein HIV patients were asked to wait for some time to get treatment after the doctors learnt they were HIV patients.The first patient, who had a heart ailment, was asked to come back after a few weeks. The second patient, a woman who was suffering from uterine prolapse, was told there were no beds at the hospital, they said.Deepa, a non-community coordinator, claimed that doctors do not deny providing treatment but delay it. “They also ask for proof whether they had given them in writing that they wouldn’t treat them. We have intervened and in talks with authorities concerned to get them treatment,” she added.Treatment for co-infection like tuberculosis is easily available and it is not the case for co-morbidities like tooth ache, heart and kidney problems, claim sources. After the National Community Care Centre scheme, which reserved 10 beds for HIV patients and offered free treatment, was scrapped in 2012, treatment for HIV patients has taken a beating, sources add.AIDS programme Officer (in-charge) Dr C Suvarna admitted that the issue of delayed treatment was raised at a meeting but specific instances were not brought up to them. “No one can deny treatment and in such a case one can complain to us,” she said. The officer however claimed that for medical reasons treatment could have been delayed or postponed. “Moreover, surgeries have to be done under extra care and it would take some time. We can analyse if the case was brought to us and whether it is ‘willful’ delay or not,” she said.Stats:** A total of 18,175 persons have been affected with HIV in Mysuru district.

Elisa test not enough for AIDS detection,2017-12-01,LUCKNOW,"News,City News,Lucknow News","LUCKNOW: Doctors in UP still rely over Elisa as compared to NAT for HIV detection. “Elisa is used because it is cost effective and is an easily available technology. The test is sensitive to the virus and detects positive cases sooner or later,” said RC Srivastava , joint director, targeted intervention, UPSACS which runs the HIVAIDS control programme in the state.Besides KGMU, NAT facility is available at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences. But neither uses it for screening of HIV. AT KGMU, which also runs an Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) for HIV, NAT positive cases detected at the state blood bank are eventually referred to ICTC which sends them for confirmatory test done using Elisa.“As a result, several NAT HIV positive cases may fall under Elisa HIV negative category which is not in the interest of patients as they will eventually be detected HIV positive in afew months,” said Prof Chandra. Chief medical superintendent, KGMU, Prof SN Shankhwar said they will look into the possibility of using NAT in ICTC.UP State AIDS Control Society and KGMU being at variance over data regarding prevalence of HIV-AIDS in the state is a matter of serious concern. KGMU, with its advanced NAT method of blood testing, considered the gold standard, is better placed than UPSACS which is straddled with Elisa test alone. The state should work towards upgrading its infrastructure so that NAT method is introduced as soon as possible. A more realistic survey would present the correct picture, which will result in dealing with the problem with greater alacrity, reach out to more patients and bigger aid that is actually needed. If we do not accurately know how big the problem is, it’s solution will always fall short of the requirement."

Disease-specific insurance becomes popular in Hyderabad,2017-12-14,HYDERABAD,"News,City News,Hyderabad News","HYDERABAD: With the count of cancer and dengue cases on the rise across the state, an increasing number of health insurance firms have started floating disease-specific plans for their customers. And apart from the high rate of occurrence, the rapidly peaking popularity of these policies, agents say, is also rooted in the cost of treatment that’s spiralled in recent times.According to rough estimates, the hospitalisation expenses for dengue can easily touch ₹1 lakh and more depending on the severity and complications associated with the patient, while treatment for cancer and other critical illness cost no less than ₹2 lakh. While this trend of diseaseoriented policies first made an inroad in to the industry roughly three years ago, it has now picked up pace in Hyderabad, say insiders. “Apart from cancer, in Hyderabad, diabetes and cardiac policies are being purchased in sizeable numbers (about 15-20 per cent) of health policies,” said Govinda Kiran , senior sales manager with a prominent health insurance company.The premium for most of these polices range between ₹20,000 and ₹60,000 annually, depending on the age and health condition of the patient. In fact most policies allow patients who have already undergone a bypass surgery or cancer treatment to avail of the facility for reoccurrence of disease (after having recovered). Firms are also seen rolling out special policies for HIV/AIDS , kidney disease, neurology, etc.But while health insurance companies are going all out to woo corporates and even general public to buy these, experts have aword of caution for the buyers.“The insurance companies usually target those places (corporates etc) where can sell a large number of policies even though the actual percentage of buyers likely to get the disease, is very low. So, people need to choose wisely as many of the critical illness are already covered under a general health policy for a higher premium,” said CV Ramana Rao , MD, Helios insurance broking"

ASCI welcomes ban on condom ads on TV channels,2017-12-15,"New Delhi, Dec 15 () Advertising sector watchdog ASCI today welcomed the government decision to ban condom ads on TV channels between 6 am and 10 pm, saying such adverts focus on sensationalism to grab eyeballs rather than being educative about the benefits of condom usage.

The Information and Broadcasting Ministry on December 11 issued an advisory to all television channels to restrict condom advertisements to late night between 10 pm and 6 am.

The ASCI said its Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) in recent times has received complaints against condom ads with explicit adult content being aired during family viewing hours, requesting the watchdog to declare a ban on them.

""Some of the condom advertisements are detrimental to the children's sensibilities as they focus on sensationalising the act and play heavily on sexual content to grab eyeballs rather than being educative, informative and focused on the benefits of condom usage for audience of all age groups,"" ASCI said.

The ministry said it was brought to its notice that some channels carry advertisements of condoms repeatedly which are alleged to be indecent, especially for children.

The decision was taken after the ASCI had suggested the government to consider restricting the telecast of sexually explicit condom advertisements during watershed hours of 10 pm to 6 am so that exposure to pre-teens could be minimised.

ASCI Secretary General Shweta Purandare said ads that were complained against were not about HIV protection, prevention of teenage pregnancy or population control but instead focussed on sexual titillation, highlighting product flavours or features, which made them embarrassing and distasteful to be viewed especially in the presence of children during family viewing hours.

Why a Sunny Leone ad can’t teach children about safe sex,2018-01-31,Sex in advertising is obviously nothing new,News,"Sex in advertising is obviously nothing new: the first known example goes back to the 1870s, when an American tobacco company used images of nude women to sell its product (very successfully, by the way). And since then, sex has been used to promote a miscellany of products, from soaps to cars, creating controversies in the process, all over the world. The ban on condom advertising is just the latest example of this — and it will not be the last. But a lot of notably silly things have been said in the process, and it is important that we take a sensible, nuanced view of the issue, and do not miss the wood for the trees. Or the condoms for the rubber.And for that we need to understand how advertising works — and how it doesn’t. The immediate provocation for the ban appears to have been the TV ads for Manforce condoms, featuring Sunny Leone (exacerbated perhaps by the hoarding campaign for the brand aimed at the Navaratri youth audience, which caused an uproar in Gujarat ). The fact is that Manforce’s advertising and marketing campaign has been extremely successful, and has quickly driven the brand into the big league, challenging long-standing brand leaders like Kama Sutra and Durex . It has managed to do this by powerfully connecting with the emotions of its defined target audience — young adults, 18-30 years old — and presenting itself as the most appealing choice among condoms. Given the context of the product-audience relationship, this necessarily means being titillating, provocative or sexy in some way. And that is where the problem arises, because one person’s titillation is another person’s ‘obscenity’. To quote one particularly ridiculous example, the well-loved old Vicks ‘Gale mein khich-khich’ ad ended with the little moppet winking at her father — a shot that the authorities of the time demanded be cut out. But that is the way it has always been, and that’s probably the way it always will.

However, the flip side of this is that ads like these, sharply targeted at adults as they are, should not be exposed to kids, for whom they are arguably an undesirable influence (how would you feel, for example, if you were watching this ad sitting beside your 12-year-old daughter or son?) To that extent it makes sense that, like adult movies, such ads — whether for condoms, or for any other product category — should be aired at a time when they are most likely to be seen by only their intended target group, and not by unintended audiences, like children. That is what any responsible advertiser will understand — because if they do not regulate themselves, they are merely laying themselves open to being regulated by the authorities. It is a universal phenomenon.In this entire controversy, many oddball points of view have been raised. One of them is the view that condom ads must be made accessible to children because they are a source of sex education for them. This is both ignorant and laughable. The fact is that an ad for any brand of condom — whether Manforce or any other — has one, and only one, job to do: to create a brand preference for the brand over other condom brands, and thus increase sales. If it did not focus single-mindedly on that task, it would be unprofessional and irresponsible. So what about the task of educating the public about issues like unwanted pregnancy and safe sex?That, needless to say, is a critically important task in a country like India, with its surging population, low condom usage, high abortion rate and alarming HIV statistics. But the professional take on this would be that these are totally different tasks, with totally different challenges — and must therefore be solved independently, using different strategies and emotional appeals. And what that would call for are separate communications campaigns, to be run by the government, drawing upon the most professional advertising and marketing resources available to it (as had, in fact, been done in the case of the Nirodh condom campaign, way back in the 1960s).One key imperative in all this, of course, is an intelligently designed multi-media sex education programme custom created for high school children. And here, again, the government needs to draw on the finest creative resources available. One global benchmark, for example, was the brilliant sex education programme developed in the UK in the 1970s, where they drew on talents like cartoonist Gray Joliffe and author Peter Mayles to create a wonderfully engaging series of books and interactive materials to make sure that exactly the right messaging went out in exactly the right tone of voice — but, even more importantly, in a manner that children would actually enjoy and internalise. Given the seriousness of our problem, the sooner we understand all this, and act upon it, the better.*The writer is an advertising professional"
Attack on doctors: Now medicos being trained in communication skills,2017-12-18,Aurangabad,"News,City News,Aurangabad News","Aurangabad: Often heated arguments between doctors and their patients’ relatives take violent turns and the medical practitioners are attacked. Taking a serious note of the issue, the health department decided to train doctors in communication skills.Minister for medical education Girish Mahajan has approved a state-wide movement ‘Susanwaad Abhiyaan’ to train and polish soft skills of medical professionals.A Thane-based social organisation Origin Foundation is facilitating the movement.The authorities privy to the project believe that with development and improvement of certain skills, the friction between the patients’ relatives and the doctors will lessen.Hospitals across the state have witnessed around 60 cases of attacks on doctors by their patients’ kin in the past two years.Doctor groups such as The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) and Indian Medical Association (IMA) have expressed dissent over the incidents and the security management at government and private hospitals have been made stricter. Yet the incidents keep recurring.A resident doctor was in the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) was assaulted by an HIV positive patients’ kin after he died on November 12.After this incident the GMCH hosted a four-hour workshop at Mahatma Gandhi auditorium on Saturday under the Susanwaad project.The head of GMCH’s medical unit Sayeda Afroz said, “Origin Foundation’s Sandeep Mane conducted eight sessions at the workshop which was attended by 250 people.”“The workshop was attended by 100 resident doctors, students and interns. It helped them understand how bad news such as cancer or declaring the patient dead should be broken down to the patients’ relatives, to avoid conflict,” Afroz said.Senior resident doctor at GMCH Pranay Jambhulkar said, “The role play method in the workshop guided us on how to deal with day-to-day things. They pointed out the mistakes made by taking real life examples.”The GMCH dean asked the audience to keep the patient and kin informed about the treatment. Incidentally, the MBBS syllabus does not include a module that teaches this.“The directorate of medical education and research in Mumbai is considering including a module on Attitude and Communication (ATCOM) in the five-year course,” Afroz said.“GMCH plans to conduct more workshops throughout the year. We are also planning on accommodating the nursing staff, ward boys and the support staff in the training programme,” she added."
Sex education? To teach or not is no more the question,2017-12-18,"The Centre may have banned daytime ads for condoms on television, but for children growing up in the internet era, ‘forbidden’ facts are available at their fingertips. But while information may be plenty, experts said not all that’s on the net is authentic and that it was crucial for schools to make sex education a part of their curriculum.Several schools back the view that children should be properly educated on sex rather than weaned away from such ads.Sex education is almost non-existent, it is not defined in the curriculum,” said Vishnucharan P, correspondent of Shree Niketan Group of Schools . “Although biology classes include a portion of the basics, students are not updated in terms of information provided. Students come from different religious, cultural and economic backgrounds and teachers do not want to take the onus of delving into these topics as they are not sure of reactions they will get from different sections.”Revathy Bonns, principal of MCC Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Chetpet, said other than the lessons included under biology, there is no proper sex education. “The concept of contraceptives is a topic touched upon in biology books but it doesn’t get into details. Children are very curious about these issues and they need to be made aware of them in the right way,” she said.Many students said they barely came across such topics in classes. Deepthi S, who entered Class XIII this year, said there were no sex education classes in her classes.

"Jail inmate earns 3 degrees while in prison, motivates others",2017-12-24,BENGALURU,"News,City News,Bengaluru News,Schools & Colleges","BENGALURU: A promising cricketer, G Yellappa’s life changed course when he was convicted of murder in 2003. But if life in jail taught him anything, it was that learning is a non-stop process. Today, after 14 years in prison, Yellappa has bagged three degrees – a bachelor of arts, a master of arts in journalism and communication, and an MA in public administration, apart from an ongoing attempt at an MA in Ambedkar Studies.Yellappa enrolled with Bangalore University’s department of distance education, from where he received all the degrees. The 37-year-old, who is expected to walk out of central prison in Parappana Agrahara next year, plans to dedicate his life to teaching.In an interview to All India Radio, Vividh Bharati, Bengaluru, the recording of which was provided to TOI, Yellappa spoke of how the importance of education dawned on him during his prison days.“I am the last of eight children in my family. After Class 7, I stopped going to school. After news spread that at 23 I had stabbed the organizer of a match at Bhagat Singh stadium in Doddaballapur, I was branded a rowdy, something I never believed I was,” said Yellappa.“But 14 years is a long time for someone to learn about law and order and to also make the most of this time, which I had no choice but to endure. I got a new lease of life through these courses and I am grateful to the university for bringing these courses to the confines of the prison,” he added.Yellappa has also managed to inspire other inmates to take up these courses. “Around 97 inmates enrolled for the courses after they saw me and others receiving our degrees. Our aim is to get others to make use of this provision and study further,” said Yellappa.The university has already received applications from nearly 300 inmates for the next academic year. Speaking to TOI, Prof B C Mylarappa, director, directorate of correspondence courses and distance education, BU, said, “We are expecting around 700 applications from the inmates. Many are keen to take up these courses and it’s very heartening to see that.”In a bid to promote higher education among all sections of society, BU will soon start enrolling candidates for its distance education courses for free. The initiative will cater to those belonging to the SC , ST, other backward classes, persons with disability, women, LGBTs, HIV/AIDS infected persons, liberated bonded labourers, jail inmates, victims of acid attack, sweepers and scavengers.“The department provides an annual revenue of Rs 27 crore to the university. Providing free education to those who can’t afford it is the single most important thing a public funded university must do,” said Mylarappa.The department, which began operations in 1974, had awarded distance education degrees to 47,000 students till 2013. After the UGC mandated a shut down of all distance education programmes owing to violation over jurisdiction in 2013, the department was shut till 2015.“When we reopened, we were certain that the department has to function on the lines of UGC recommendations. BU is the only state university to be offering these courses through this model,” Mylarappa added.Mylarappa said the number of enrollees for the courses rose from 3,000 in 2016-17 to 7,000 in 2017-18. Enrolment for next academic year closes on December 30."

21 Haridwar jail inmates found to be HIV positive,2017-12-25,HARIDWAR,"News,City News,Dehradun News","HARIDWAR: A recent survey conducted by the Uttarakhand State AIDS Control Society found 21 jail inmates of Haridwar district jail to be HIV positive. The Haridwar jail houses 1,175 prisoners, including 60 women, and samples were collected from all of them, including 450 undertrials, in July 2017.The jail administration on Sunday said that all the affected inmates are undertrials and most of them are accused in theft cases. The administration, however, added that the virus didn’t spread inside the jail and the undertrials were already affected.Jailor of Haridwar district jail, S M Singh , said, “The 21 male inmates, aged between 25 and 27, were already affected with HIV. However, they didn’t know that they were carrying the virus. Seven of the 21 are, at present, out on bail and 14 others are being treated by the AIDS control society. They are all small burglars and were arrested in various cases of thefts. All are uneducated and belong to poor families.”He added that most of them are drug addicts, and in all probability, they got infection through intravenous (IV) drug use.Meanwhile, the district administration has asked the jail authority to take proper measures in the matter. District magistrate Deepak Rawat said, “It is a serious matter and all possible steps are being taken to check the spread of the infection within the jail. Proper medical treatment is being administered to all the affected inmates. The narcotic bureau of Dehradun has also examined the report.”The use of IV drugs such as heroin, cocaine and crystal methamphetamines have increased in the past couple of years in Haridwar, especially in the slum areas of the district.Social worker Vishal Garg said, “IV drugs are easily available at every other medical store in Haridwar. The health department is also not taking any measures to curb the use and sale of the drugs. Earlier, mostly homeless youths used IV drugs but now youngsters living in the slums have also started buying these drugs, which is a major cause of HIV spread.”Amarjeet Singh, SHO of Jwalapur police station, said, “A packet of IV drugs is sold for Rs 250 and because of its easy availability and low cost people are buying it. We had recently taken action against two medical stores in Jwalapur area for selling intravenous drugs used by addicts. Three people were also arrested.”"

The patients were reluctant to visit a government hospital due to long queues and unhygienic conditions. They had no money for treatment in private facilities.“Most of the patients — who we convinced to visit a government hospital — had flu-like symptoms. They were not ready to go to a hospital because they were worried that they would end up spending a lot of time in long queues. Some had this fear that their condition might deteriorate further because of the unhygienic conditions at the hospital,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari , president, Helping Hand Foundation He said that from the beginning of December, they have been able to bring in 200 patients to government hospitals. “On Friday, we encountered a case of a 10-day-old girl born to a HIV-positive couple . Her parents were finding it hard to feed the baby and the mother couldn’t feed her as she was afraid of transmitting the disease to the kid. The new born has now been provided with milk powder,” he said, adding that many patients with diabetes were also identified in the last few days and given medicines.NGO officials said the main aim of the campaign was to check for major and minor ailments and help patients get into the public health system for free treatment. The primary focus of the NGO is on children’s health (vaccinations), TB and other chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). So far, 17 active TB cases have been identified."
They home-deliver psychosocial and medical support to 600 HIV families,2017-12-28,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News,Civic Issues News","MUMBAI: When Shabina Khan found out in 2008 that she had HIV, she considered it a life sentence. The health of her husband, who was also HIV positive, was deteriorating. Doctors told her his death was imminent. So, the Bandra (E) reside-nt spent the next five months nu-rsing her bedridden husband, worrying about the HIV status of their three daughters and dipping into the family’s meagre financial reserves to fund their treatment. “I was sick of living,” recalls Khan. “I even tried committing suicide by drinking phenyl.” Khan agreed to TOI using her name and photo.That’s when another HIV patient who saw her crying directed her to Committed Communities Development Trust (CCDT), an organization committed to developing and implementing a home-based care programme for families living with HIV or AIDS . Today, the organization, which has been around since 1990, caters to 600 families across Mumbai by providing psychosocial legal and medical support . “When we started this work, we found that lots of children with HIV positive parents were institutionalized because their parents could no longer work and look after them,” explains Poonam Patkar, who has been with CCDT for 10 years. “So, we decided to provide home-based care in order to strengthen the capacity of the family.”Khan was initially hesitant to approach CCDT fearing her privacy would be breached. But it turned out to be the best decision she’d made. “Since my husband was bedridden, I’d given up hope of continuing my children’s education in a good, private school,” she recalls. “But CCDT helped me with the fees.” They also took her husband to a hospital and got him treatment. It turned out his symptoms were more a result of tuberculosis than HIV. He’s now back at work. “People from my community wouldn’t help me because of the stigma surrounding my illness,” says Khan, “but CCDT took me in as one of their own.”CCDT teaches families about the importance of taking antiretroviral drugs regularly and what do in case a HIV positive family member gets a cut or has an open wound. “We give them a first aid kit and teach them to use gloves,” says Patkar. “If families can’t afford gloves, we tell them to use plastic bags.” They also provide information about treatments. For instance, Khan had no idea that government hospitals provided free antiretroviral treatment and used up all her savings at a private hospital.Most families that CCDT works with have a monthly income of about Rs 5,000-6,000 and are daily wagers. This makes CCDT’s nutritional kit of 13 items, including jaggery, peanuts, oil and soyabean, a godsend because it helps supplement their diet when they have to stay home from work because they aren’t feeling well.To help patients recover hope after being diagnosed, CCDT has set up family support groups that meet every month. “When I joined CCDT’s support group I heard other people sharing their stories and after such a long time…I began to feel hopeful about the future,” CCDT quoted Khan as saying in a press release. Today, Khan wows her family with her sunny outlook and derives satisfaction from counselling new CCDT entrants, who are struggling with their diagnosis."
"Despite shortage, India discards 1m blood units per year",2017-12-28,"India discards over a million units of blood collected every year, according to health ministry data. This is despite facing a severe blood shortage as only 9.9 million units are collected against the estimated annual requirement of 10-12 million units.The reasons for collected blood having to be discarded include deterioration during storage and expiry due to outdating. The largest chunk of the wasted units is plasma, which could be used for various life-saving treatments. A unit of blood (450 ml) can potentially save at least three lives, according to the World Health Organisation On an average, about six units of blood is needed for every open heart surgery, while a roadside accident victim could require up to 100 units. One out of every 10 people admitted to a hospital needs blood, according to WHO data.The health ministry data was tabled in the Lok Sabha in response to a question. Reactivity for infections (malaria, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C) and expiry due to outdating, especially for platelets, which have a short shelf life of only 5 days, are among the reasons offered by the ministry. Others include deterioration during storage in the form of discolouration, haemolysis, bacterial contamination, not meeting quality parameters after collection and production and non-completion of blood collection in requisite quantities due to donor reactions.The ministry added that though India does not have a National Blood Transfusion Service , since public health is a state subject, state blood transfusion councils are set up in every state to monitor proper functioning of blood transfusion services.Patients need blood after major accidents or surgeries in which there is loss of blood. After a miscarriage or childbirth, the patient may need transfusion of a large amount of blood for saving her life or the child's. For patients with blood diseases like severe anaemias, leukaemias (blood cancer), haemophilia (bleeding disorder) and thalassemia, repeated blood transfusions are the only solution. In many other situations too, like poisoning, drug reactions, shock and burns, blood transfusion is the only way to save life.WHO estimates that blood donation by 1% of a country's population is generally sufficient to meet its basic requirements for safe blood.

According to a response tabled in the Lok Sabha , 29% of the posts in TN anganwadi centers are vacant — highest in the country.Started in 1975 as part of the ICDS to combat hunger and malnutrition, they also serves as preschools for poor children.

Excluding Tamil Nadu, Bihar, West Bengal Nagaland and Uttar Pradesh, the percentage of vacancies against its sanctioned strengthwas in singledigitin alltheother states.Asenior official of thedepartment of social welfare and nutritious meal programme said the response was based on data given by the state in April. “We had recruited people to fill these posts but it was delayed because of various litigations,” said the official, adding that in the last eight months at least15,000 openings in 19 districts were filled. “There’s a case challenging appointments in Theni, Pudukottai and Dindigul. The recruitment process is underway in other districts,” hesaid.A Devaneyan of Thozhamai , who did a social audit in 500 ICDS centres in 20 districts in the state in 2013 said staff shortage has been a constant spanner in the ICDS wheel.Andrew Sesuraj, assistant professor, department of social work at Loyola college said lack of transparency in the recruitment process is the biggest challenge. “Although the respective district collectors are in charge of filling vacancies, local ward councilors and MLAs prepare the list of women for these posts,” hesaid.Vinitha*, 38-year-old mother of two from Tiruchengode in Namakkal, is among those who got caught in this vortex. “They cited by HIV positive status for not giving me the job although I’m qualified,” said Vinitha.

These viruses are transmitted by blood and blood products, sexual contact, vertical transmission (mother to child transmission during pregnancy or during birth). Unsterilised needle usage, improper sterilisation of dental, surgical and endoscopic instruments, reuse of razor blades appear to be other most common causes that lead to the spread of these viruses in the community,” said Dr K S Somasekhar Rao , consultant gastroenterologist and hepatologist at Apollo Hospital.Hepatitis Viruses are the second most common cause of liver cirrhosis worldwide, as per statistics provided by doctors.

HepBest (TAF) is the first drug in eight years to be approved for the management of chronic hepatitis B in India, says a company statement. Natco and Hetero are also in the process of launching the drug, industry sources say. The drug TAF demonstrates comparable efficacy, with an enhanced renal and bone safety profile as compared to earlier formulation of tenofovir (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate)According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, over 2 billion people worldwide are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), of which over 240 million have chronic liver infection.The cost of treatment for ‘HepBest’ will be Rs 1900 per month, the product is available in pack of 30s. Going forward with economies of scale, the prices are expected to come down like it has been the case for Tenofovir and Entecavir, a company spokesperson said.These patients are at risk of developing serious illness and death, largely resulting from liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. TAF demonstrates comparable efficacy with an enhanced renal and bone safety profile as compared to the earlier formulation of tenofovir (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). TAF also has greater plasma stability , which ensures efficient drug delivery to the site of action.Commenting on the launch, Rakesh Bamzai, president, India and emerging markets said, “India has an estimated 40 million HBV carriers, of which 15% to 25% could go on to suffer from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Mylan continues to be in the forefront of introducing new treatment regimens for the management of hepatitis in India”.In 2014, Mylan signed an agreement with Gilead to enhance access to TAF-based HIV treatments in developing countries. As part of the licensing agreement, on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, Mylan received a technology transfer from Gilead, enabling it to manufacture low-cost versions of TAF."

The camp was held to mark world aids day, observed on December 1.The department called 100 HIV positive patients getting treatment at its ART centre, for blood tests to detect hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV).For this year, the World Health Organisation has set ‘everyone counts’ as the theme. Meenakshi Bhattacharya , the nodal officer at the ART centre in the GMCH said, “Keeping in line with the theme, the department is committed to provide quality treatment to all patients with the aim to eradicate the fatal disease.”According to studies, the prevalence of HBV is high in HIV positive individuals and women are more commonly infected than men. Whereas men are more commonly infected by HCV. However, the prevalence of HCV is lower than HBV. Consequently, screening HIV positive individuals for the hepatitis viruses is crucial.GMCH dean Kanan Yelikar encouraged the HIV positive patients to take consistent treatment from ART centre and to take regular medication without disruptions as advised.

We request the central government to integrate the tests for the two diseases at ICTCs and ARTs.”Dr D Behera, chairman of the National Task Force , said though it is mandatory for government medical colleges and hospitals to inform the state task force about the number of TB patients visiting the hospital, they are not doing so.“Operational researches, a part of Revised National TB Control Programme, are not being conducted at medical colleges. The burden of TB is more on the east zone due to existence of mines which lead to the disease,” he added.In 2016, nearly 65,000 TB cases were diagnosed in government medical colleges and 30,000 in private hospitals in Bihar alone. “The expected diagnosis for sensitive cases in Bihar could be nearly two lakhs as many patients go to private hospitals for treatment,” said state programme officer for TB Dr (Major) K N Sahai.He added 38 cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test machines are installed at different hospitals in the state. “Another 32 machines will be installed soon at ART centres and bigger sub-divisional hospitals,” added Dr Sahai. These machines carry out DNA based identification and diagnostic tests."

The hospital reported him to be HIV positive.Ahmad had applied for a job in Dubai and the test was part of his fitness requirement.

Prima facie it appears that the complainant has been victim of incompetence of the centre as he has been wrongfully reported to be having HIV positive and declared unfit vide their report February 1, 2017 and made to suffer because of that,” the DMC wrote in its letter to the DGHS and sought closure of the facility.The DMC order said stringent action including closure of the centre is needed as it is apprehended that such a centre may not be equipped or have proper qualified doctors to run lab tests."

As such mothers are motivated, they take medicines regularly, and the fixed dose is continued for a lifetime. When a baby is six weeks old, an HIV test is done. If it turns out to be negative, then the test is done again at six months, and again at 18 months if it is negative.

The sewage outlet of the laboratory has also become a matter of concern for the local residents as the sewage outlet of the locality is also linked to a sewage line that flows into the Upper Lake.“After we raised the issue, the direction flow of the sewage line has been moved eastward (parallel to Narmada pipeline)”, said local corporator Mohammed Saud. Sources said that BMC is yet to finalise the sewage outlet connection of the laboratory. It is likely to flow towards Motia Talab section. The laboratory, listed as biological safety levels (BSL) level II, would deal with agents associated with human diseases, both pathogenic or infections organisms. Examples of agents typically worked with in a BSL-2 include equine encephalitis viruses and HIV, as well as staph infections. More common tests like hepatitis A, B, and C, influenza A, lyme disease, measles, HIV and H1N1 would also be conducted in the laboratory, said GMC official.Originally, the sanction for the laboratory was pegged at Rs 22-crore. However, given its proximity to a petrol pump, the sanction of approvals for biological safety levels (BSL) level II laboratory is in doubt. In 2012, scoping exercise was carried out by environment planning and coordination organization (EPCO) for the laboratory under the department of microbiology at GMC. Four floors with built-up area of 10,000 sq feet each is ready for possession. India’s premier facility High Security Animal Disease Laboratory (HSADL) is also located in Bhopal The laboratory is bio-safety level-IV containment laboratory. “Construction of virology laboratory has been completed. We are waiting for recruitments to take place for the start of the services at the laboratory,” said a senior GMC official. The advanced laboratory has been delayed by five years.According to GMC officials, the opening was to coincide with the opening ceremony of new OPD wing by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan that is expected to take place later this month. Over 1,000 cases of influenza A are being reported each day in the state capital. OPD inflow in private and government hospital with cases of flu, fever and respiratory ailments is on the increase, said experts."

The whole episode had a whiff of alleged discrimination against the woman she is suffering from a disease, which it seems is still considered to be a social taboo here.The unprecedented turn of events left the patient, with an extremely low haemoglobin count and her relatives shaken. “I was told by Sultania hospital doctors to return to the government hospital in Sehore, where I gave birth to a baby. Sehore doctors referred me to Bhopal by saying that I needed care at a higher hospital. I feel like a total outcast. Rights of patients like me, who are suffering from HIV infection, need to be protected.”The patient was referred to the state capital, hours after she delivered a baby on Tuesday morning. Her newborn was admitted to the neonatal care unit in Sehore. In her mid-20s, the woman underwent a normal delivery in the Sehore hospital and after being given some much-needed blood, her condition was expected to stabilise.The woman’s relatives also alleged discrimination and saw no reason for her referral. “My sister was shivering and had high temperature. But, we could very well sense that she was not welcome in the hospital, like other regular patients,” said the patient’s sister. The family travelled to Bhopal by road and reached the Sultania hospital. They are residents of a village some 22 kilometres away from Sehore town.At around 4 pm on Tuesday, Sehore-based government hospital gynaecologist Dr Amita Shirvatava explained the situation by saying “The patient had a medical condition, including low blood pressure and pulmonary issues. It was my opinion that the patient would be better served at a higher centre.”Speaking to TOI, chief medical and research officer (CMHO) Dr A Qureshi said, “Prima facie there is no indication of discrimination. However, a full report has been sought from the concerned department.”“I am aware of an HIV positive patient coming to the hospital. However, her admission or otherwise is not known to me. I would have to investigate the matter,” said Dr Aruna Kumar, the head of department of gynaecology at Sultania hospital.After a call to the CMHO, within a span of two hours hospital officials informed that the HIV patient was admitted again in Sehore. She was discharged from Sultania hospital and taken back to Sehore within hours of being referred to Bhopal.“The woman was referred after a successful intervention. There is no discrimination in the matter,” said Dr Malti Arya, the doctor who was on duty when the patient was referred to Bhopal.Sources said few months back, another HIV positive patient, who reached the same government hospital for her delivery, was forced to opt for a delivery at a private hospital."

Extra marital affairs spike HIV cases,2017-11-23,TRICHY,"News,City News,Trichy News","TRICHY: Incidence of people tested positive for HIV has witnessed a major change in Trichy . Going by the Data of District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), of late, there has been an increase in cases between the age group of 40 to 49 years. Experts say the major reason for the change in trend in the viral disease is due to extramarital affairs.District Program Manager (DPM) of DAPCU, Trichy Dr SM Manivannan says, “The trend has changed after 2011. Analysis shows that the trend is a consequence of illicit affairs among married people. But on the whole, the prevalence of HIV-AIDS is declining.”Earlier, the incidence was prevalent among people in the age group of 30 to 39 years, due to the unawareness of the high risk behavior groups - Female Sex Workers (FSW), Men Sex with Men (MSM) and transgender (TG). “HIV positive was high among the risk behavior groups, but after 2011 the trend declined and common people too have been tested positive,” said Dr Manivannan.Stating that the number of infected people is under control in Trichy district, the DPM said that currently 5,500 people were on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) treatment here. The number included FSW, MSM, TG and normal people.Few years ago, there was a panic among HIV-infected people that the viral infection was the end of their life. Now, doctors term it as a chronically manageable disease. “If a patient is regularly on ART, the life expectancy of the patient will not decrease,” said Dr R Sharmila at ART Centre inside Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). ART is a tablet which was prescribed to those who had CD4 count below 300. However, the tablet has been made available to all infected people irrespective of their CD4 count.“The regular follow-up on patients and intake of ART tablet increases the longevity of the patients. If anyone was missing out on treatment, the Target Intervention (TI)-NGOs will keep track of them and bring them back on track for treatment,” he said."

"Now, dengue and HIV tests in 20 mins in U’khand",2017-11-24,DEHRADUN,"News,City News,Dehradun News","DEHRADUN: In a move to improve overall diagnostic services in the hills of Uttarakhand, health department has introduced a next-generation instrument — Health Cube — which will help pathologists conduct health tests of patients within minutes.Patients can know their HIV, dengue, malaria or typhoid status within a few minutes rather waiting for 24 hours. The instrument will give results of not just regular body tests but will also give result of hepatitis B and C, cardiac tests, diabetes and kidney tests too.To start with around 11 of these devices have been distributed in Pauri and Udham Singh Nagar districts. After noting the response of these 11 instruments, the department plans to have more of them on board.The move is significant for Uttarakhand because it plans to introduce tele-medicine facility in all government hospitals very soon, according to the health advisor to CM, Dr Naveen Baluni.Quick reports of patients from all the hospitals would justify having tele-medicine facility for Uttarakhand, which will start on an initial investment of Rs 3 crore. The reports would be shared with patients, hospital and doctors through apps, emails and text messages. Electronic health data of patients would also be saved.Director general of health department, Dr Archana Shrivastava said, “As we have a long-term goal of connecting all the facilities under health department with tele-medicines, this equipment will aid our doctors immensely. It will prove a boon for patients as they will get immediate results in shortest duration. So far we are providing free diagnostic facilities in 30 major hospitals, 28 community health centres and 17 public health centres. However, due to unavailability of manpower and adequate resource, especially in the geographically challenging areas, we could not cater to the needs of far-flung patients. This instrument will be really useful and, if converged with tele-medicine, will be a huge medical relief for the entire state.”Meanwhile, in the next step, the department is planning to introduce 50 additional advanced mobile portable instruments which would be taken to different villages during camps and to promote national health mission’s non-communicable diseases (NCD) programme, which requires the department to set up NCD clinics at various places.The move comes after the CM directed the health department to digitise a majority of its services so that day-to-day progress and lacunae could be identified and worked upon to enhance the health environment of Uttarakhand. “We have connected all the district hospitals with CCTVs. All the hospitals would now be under the surveillance of CM and DG’s office,” added Shrivastava."

Bandyopadhyay, who has been researching on cancer, Alzheimers and HIV-induced diseases for over a decade, has won the Infosys prize for creating computer-efficient algorithms to analyse biological data to gain new insights into cell behaviour.The scientist has set herself up to solve one of the biggest mysteries in the world - knowing the human cell in its entirety. Her work on cancer cell analysis and mapping of the behavioural pattern of cancerous cells have been a trendsetter of sorts and has been globally accepted. She has been concentrating mainly on breast and colon cancer and has been trying to understand the disease at the starting point - what triggers cancer.""My work starts at the micro RNA level. I study how these molecules interact and regulate production of proteins at a small level. There can be an imbalance in the protein formation inside one cell vis a vis that of others and this might cause an imbalance in cell division versus cell death,"" Bandyopadhyay explains. These RNAs are bio markers or genetic markers that hold the key to understanding and even pre-empting the disease.It is a work of computation and analysis. The data that is generated is used by bio-researchers to perform laboratory experiments for their genetic study. ""I generate a lot of data and map the behaviour of molecules... but I dream of a day when I will be present in the laboratory and perform the experiments myself alongside bio-scientists. That way, I will get a hands-on experience of how the data works in reality,"" she said.The world has already advanced quite a bit as far as cancer prediction from gene sequencing is concerned. ""There are many who are getting themselves screened for this and are even going in for mastectomy. We are working to better the technology by studying bio or genetic markers, plotting the findings on a graph and analyzing them ,"" Bandyopadhyay said, adding that perhaps in the next 50 years, cancer screening will become as simple as routine blood tests."

"Scrap Aadhaar, it’s snatching away our right to food, privacy: Citizens",2017-10-27,BENGALURU,"News,City News,Bengaluru News","BENGALURU: “The lines on our fingers have faded due to the nature of work and it is the only source of income for our families. But the ration shop dealer is turning us away saying our biometric data does not match,” rued 60-year-old Jayamma, an agarbatti maker living in Samil slum of Cottonpet.She was one among the many aggrieved members from marginalized communities who took part in the public hearing on Aadhaar-related denial of social security held here on Thursday and aired their woes.Organized by the Right to Food (RTF) campaign, an informal network of individuals and organizations committed to the realization of the right to food in India, the hearing sought to bring to light the exclusionary nature of Aadhaar and its misuse to systematically isolate the needy despite repeated Supreme Court orders reiterating its voluntary nature.Jayamma complained that introduction of the biometric system to verify beneficiaries at ration stores has turned her life miserable. She hasn’t received her share for the past two months. “The ration shop dealer is also threatening us with cancellation of the card if we don’t get the issue rectified but several trips to the food commissioner’s office yielded no results,” she said.Chandrika, a 39-year-old woman who has been living with HIV for the past 20 years, is facing a different problem. She pointed out that making Aadhaar mandatory to avail the life-saving antiretroviral (ART) therapy is in violation of the right to privacy. “We have the right to confidentiality about our status. Many people like me have stopped using this drug because our treatment, if linked with Aadhaar, would reveal our HIV status. We live in a society where there’s a lot of stigma and discrimination against persons living with HIV/AIDS. I reject Aadhaar as it goes against my right to life,” she said.With the provisions of rations, medical care in case of serious conditions like cancer, tuberculosis, HIV-AIDS, midday meals, pensions, gas connections, abortions, sonograms and even death certificates being dependant on Aadhaar seeding and linking, most beneficiaries have been made to run from pillar to post. Violation of privacy and overarching threat of constant surveillance are the concern for the middleclass urban citizens.Aggrieved citizens from Ramanagara, Kolar, Belagavi, Tumakuru and Chikkaballapura put their ‘testimonies’ before a panel of experts for their adjudication. A compilation of complaints and recommendations will be placed before the SC as it begins hearing from October 30.Usha Ramanathan, legal expert and scholar, said the reports by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) itself suggested that biometric information was unsuitable for authentication. “They themselves have admitted that using biometric information to verify anyone’s identity is faulty, making it much worse for daily wager workers. Now that we know it’s a failure, why can’t we go back to a system that works for the public? The administration should administer in accordance with the law,” she said.The Right to Food is a fundamental one but it is being sabotaged and misused because of this sham identification mechanism. If the government says it is to remove fake and ghost cards from the system, they also need to investigate criminals who allowed this malpractice in the first place, instead of punishing beneficiaries. Form a special investigation team for this-Col. Matthew Thomas, petitioner in the right to privacy case and RTI activist."
"With Rs 32,000 crore scam, Telgi left his mark on counterfeit passports, stamp paper",2017-10-27,BENGALURU,"News,City News,Bengaluru News,Crime","BENGALURU: Kareem Lala Made Most Of The Loopholes In The System And Pushed In Fakes To Make A Fortune His crime spread across 18 states and more than 70 towns. Having originated in Maharashtra, spread over Andhra Pradesh and flourished in Karnataka before going to other states, the fake stamp paper scam that Abdul Kareem Telgi alias Kareem Lala masterminded, dealt the economy a Rs 32,000-crore blow, as estimated in 2002-2003, after his arrest in 2001.At its peak, Telgi's operations had more than 350 agents who sold fake stamp papers to bulk buyers, including banks, stock brokerage companies and insurance firms. People familiar with his case say that his arrest also exposed how weak the bureaucracy's moral fabric was.Reports soon after his arrest had pointed out how an artificial shortage of stamp paper was engineered by conniving officials at the Indian Security Press, Nashik. Several government officials, including police officials, some of whom had disproportionate assets worth 100 times their salaries, worked in cahoots with Telgi.His agent and trusted lieutenant Sheik Waheed is credited with having found loopholes to establish a network in at least four states: Maharashtra, then Andhra Pradesh (including Telangana), Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.Telgi may have become infamous for his stamp paper scam -for the sheer scale of operations and value of money involved -but he began his counterfeiting career by making fake passports. His operation involved foreign bills, brokers' notes, insurance policies, share transfer certificates and insurance agency stamps.Telgi was born in 1961 in Khanapur, Belagavi district.His mother, Shariefabee Ladsaab Telgi, was widowed when he was still young. A story narrated by many who knew him, is that he funded his own education at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Khanapur. He managed to study at the English-medium school by selling fruits and vegetables on trains.A BCom graduate, Telgi flew to Saudi Arabia where he worked for seven years before returning to Belagavi in 1989, and later moved to Mumbai.Initially, he worked with a travel agency as a collection manager. A few months later, he opened his own travel agency in Dalal Street, Mumbai.Soon, Telgi became the go-to man for those looking for fake documents, including stamps, stamp paper, ID cards, marks cards and so on. He was arrested by Mumbai police in 1992 for selling fake visas to youths seeking jobs in the Gulf countries. The arrest, though, was a vista for Telgi to get into bigger things. Telgi was put up in a police lockup with one Ram Rathan Sony , who allegedly introduced him to the stamp paper faking business.Once out of jail on bail, Telgi went into overdrive, expanding his contacts among stock market brokers and officials from various governments departments.Telgi was a large-hearted man, who gave away colour TV sets and cash to officials. Telgi was the prime accused in the scam in which 60 others were arrested and 13 chargesheets were filed between 2000 and 2004 by the K a r n a t a k a S I T. T h e chargesheets ran into over 26,000 pages and included statements of 800 witnesses and over 1,000 documents.“Yeh paisa bahut buri cheez hai, saab. Yeh aadmi ko banata bhi hai aur bigadta bhi hai (Money is very bad, sir. It makes a man as well as destroys him),“ Telgi is believed to have told an SIT official who was taking him to jail after he was convicted in a case.The revelation, though, did not stop Telgi from enjoying all that he could inside jail.Prison lore in Karnataka was full of tales of the benefits he managed to get. TV sets and DVD players were a regular fixture in the Bollywood fan's cell in Bengaluru jail. A big fan of Amitabh Bachchan and Pran, he is said to have played and replayed a video of a song from Zanjeer, `Yaari hai imaan mera Yaar mera zindagi...' thousands of times, triggering off a virtual revolt by fellow inmates in Bengaluru prison once. His fellow prisoners, too, were said to be beneficiaries of his munificence.By 2011, going by a report from the State Health Board Telgi's health had begun to deteriorate. While he had been suffering from diabetes for years, his counsel had once accused the police of injecting the HIV virus into his body -he was even diagnosed with AIDS. In 2012, he couldn't move as he grew weak and was confined to a wheelchair."
HIV testing lab of BHU gets NABL accreditation,2017-10-27,VARANASI,"News,City News,Varanasi News","VARANASI: The HIV Testing Laboratory Department of Microbiology at the Institute of MedicaI Sciences Banaras Hindu University has been accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL).This is the first NABL accredited lab in BHU as well as in Varanasi, said Prof Shampa Anupurba, who looks after the lab, adding that there were two visits by NABL team for quality and competency evaluation, after which NABL found HIV Testing Laboratory eligible for accreditation. The NABL recognizes the medical testing laboratories in India as per ISO15189:2012 international standard. NABL accreditation is necessary for 100% consistent and reliable test reports so that the reports generated in this laboratory can be accepted globally.According to Anupurba, the AIDS Surveillance Center was established in 1993 in the Microbiology department by National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), Government of India for the purpose of surveillance of high risk group like truck drivers, commercial sex workers etc. Later, in 1998, it was upgraded to Voluntary counseling and testing centre (VCTC). Subsequently, the VCTC was re-designated as integrated counseling and testing centre (ICTC) in 2007. In the year 2008, State Reference Laboratory (SRL) was established to ensure quality of HIV testing at ICTCs located in eastern UP.According to records, being a tertiary care centre 40,352 clients were tested for HIV at VCTC IMS BHU during 2002-2007 and 70,805 clients were tested for HIV at ICTC IMS BHU. Subsequently the client load has increased during 2012-2017 up to 1, 25,129. A total of 19095 people have been diagnosed as HIV positive for last 15 years."
Minister unhappy over unused funds for health schemes,2017-10-28,NOIDA,"News,City News,Noida News","NOIDA: Health minister Siddharth Nath Singh has expressed displeasure over the lacklustre implementation of the ongoing programmes for pregnant women and children under the National Health Mission (NHM) in the district.In a meeting with the health officials of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad , in the office of the National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR) on Thursday, the minister asked officials to fully use the funds provided by the state government for the programmes meant for pregnant women and the elderly.The state government had provided Rs 18 crore to Gautam Budh Nagar district for work under the 18 programmes under the NHM but the amount was not fully utilised so far.“The problem with the district is that we are unable to keep the women who deliver in the primary health centres in the hospital itself for even 48 hours. This is because we don’t have enough space given that the PHCs are four-bedded and there are many women coming in for delivery in the hospital. Hence, it is difficult to keep them for long. Similarly, the spending on child care is also low,” chief medical officer (CMO) Anurag Bhargava told TOI.Similarly, it was pointed out that the spending of Ghaziabad district on the vaccination front is low.“Spending of the district in scanning the patients for various infections such as Hepatitis B and HIV and blood examinations was found to be low,” an official present at the meeting said.The health officials of Gautam Budh Nagar reiterated their long-pending demand for filling up the 41 vacant posts of general purpose workers and a psychologist.These workers perform the vital role of detection of sites prone to malaria and conduct fogging in those areas.“So far, out of the total 44 posts of the workers created since the district came into being in 1997, we have only three filled. The rest are vacant. The minister has assured us that these posts will be filled,” Bhargava said."
"CFTRI will focus on food, nutrition security",2017-10-28,Mysuru,"News,City News,Mysore News","Mysuru: Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL) director Rakesh Kumar Sharma said that CFTRI and DFRL are part of the government’s bigger initiative to focus on the need for food safety, nutrition security and sustainability.Inaugurating the CFTRI Foundation Day celebrations on Friday, Sharma said CFTRI is the mecca of food technology which has contributed to improving the nutritional and health status of the population.Sharma said the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that about one in nine people -- almost 815 million -- go to bed hungry. Hunger causes more deaths than malaria, HIV and TB put together. India’s Global Hunger Index (GHI) rank is 100 this year, with a corresponding GHI score of 31.4.“India’s serious hunger level is driven by high child malnutrition and underlines the need for a stronger commitment to the social sector,” Sharma said.Sharma said that farmers are the backbone of the country’s food security; they need a sense of income security. Indian farmers are poorer than the average Indian. The growth rate in agriculture and allied sectors is approximately 4.4%.India should strive to make the country a world leader in food processing by giving an impetus to the agriculture sector, whose contribution has declined to a meagre 14% of the GDP, and on which the livelihood of 58% of the population depends. India has 141 million hectares of total cultivable land, the largest area under irrigation with 65.26 million hectares, it is the largest milk producing country with 150 tonne, largest livestock producer with 210 million cattle, second largest grain producer with 285 tonne, produces 92 metric tonne of fruits and 168.6 tonne of vegetables, largest poultry producer with 83 billion eggs per annum.“But 1.3 tonnes of food is also wasted. We import more than we export. So the PH losses can be minimized by good agriculture, AH, manufacturing, hygiene practices and food processing. Food processing is an important player in strengthening India’s role on the global platform,” Sharma said. Akshaya Patra Foundation CEO Shridhar Venkat, CFTRI director Jitendra J Jadhav, chief scientist HS Satish, chief scientist and adviser (M&A) R Subramanian, controller of administration Binod Dubey and others were present.MoU with Akshaya PatraCFTRI signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Akshaya Patra Foundation, where a series of collaborative activities such as developing innovative nutritional adjuncts as supplements under the midday meal scheme, internship programmes, customized training for midday meal workers and enabling a policy framework to implement robust malnutrition intervention by central and state governments will be taken up.As part of the celebrations, 17 employees who retired in the past year and 24 employees who completed 25 years of service were felicitated. Prizes were also distributed to 46 students who participated in various competitions, while a cash prize of Rs 3,000 was given to six pre-university students who scored the highest marks in academics.Baking skills for rural folkCFTRI announced a five-week ‘Skill development programme on baking technology’ from November 13 to December 15 as part of Skill India Campaign. The institute, which has state-of-the-art baking facilities along with expert faculty to impart quality training, will provide training at affordable rates to encourage participants from rural areas, unorganized small bakery units and lower income group.Similarly, CFTRI will also conduct entrepreneurship training programmes from November 2 to December 2 in association with Kautilya Entrepreneurship and Management Institute, Jain University, to promote startups in the food processing sector.The course ‘Entrepreneurial Opportunities in Food and Allied Sectors’ has been designed to address both technologies and entrepreneurships to support ventures in the food processing sector. The first week of the programme will be held in CFTRI and second part at Jain University campus."
Do you suffer from OCD? It's time to seek professional help,2017-10-28,BENGALURU,"News,City News,Bengaluru News,Civic Issues","BENGALURU: She was scared to shake hands with anyone, would not touch anything, not even door knobs or telephone in home, and frequently washed her hands. After suffering from such a condition since she was 10, the 60-year-old Bengaluru resident recently knocked the doors of the Obsessive and Compulsive Disorder (OCD) clinic at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences.Doctors at the Nimhans OCD clinic , which completed 20 years this June, say at least 3% of the world's total population suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder.Increasing awareness about the possibility of obsessions in daily life becoming a serious condition has resulted in more people seeking professional help.The Nimhans clinic that saw 100 OCD cases in its first year now gets at least 500 cases annually.“We see more than 500 new cases every year apart from the over 2,500 follow-up visits by more than 1,500 patients. The number of new cases is growing with increasing awareness,“ said Dr YC Janardhan Reddy, professor of psychiatry and head of the Nimhans OCD clinic.Doctors say washing hands frequently, bathing for hours, going up and down the stairs and forever logging out and logging in on computer are some of the symptoms of OCD.Though overuse of gadgets cannot be called OCD, doctors observe that addiction to gadgets and OCD systems do overlap.While a 26-year-old engineer could not stop logging in and out of his computer and made his parents do the same to save data and make sure he logged out of the system, another patient who visits the clinic would bath for 10 hours at night.Another patient feared contracting HIV infection and would bathe himself dozens of times in an hour.Counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy can help people suffering from the disorder. Doctors say about 40% of the patients don't respond satisfactorily to the first drug therapy, necessitating administration of a second drug. Incidentally, obsessive compulsive disorder is usually never treated at its onset.Drawn into the vortex of never-ending cycles of obsessions and compulsions, patients often end up harming themselves and become a burden on their families. A 45-year-old woman was so eager to get rid of virus on her hands that she constantly began washing them and the skin on her hands peeled off.The OCD clinic at Nimhans has seen 700 paediatric cases in the past 10 years. At least of 15 new cases of children in the age group 8-12 years are treated at the clinic every year.The clinic had a case of a 16-year-old boy who never went to school on time. Parents also revealed that he would never be satisfied with the way things were arranged on his study table or books were kept in his bag. He would spend at least two hours every morning arranging and rearranging various things and invariably get late to school.There have also been cases of children who would write answers but strike them down every time and end up never completing their note books and exam answer sheets.The OCD clinic at Nimhans opens at 9am every Tuesday but patients often turn up only around 10.30am.“Most of them get delayed owing to their obsessions. Most patients are aware of their problem but find it difficult to deal with it,“ said Dr YC Janardhan Reddy, head of OCD clinic, Nimhans.When OCD cases turn severe, one needs medical care, and often has to be hospitalized. Most of them don't share bathroom with other patients in general ward. “As a new hospital block is coming up, I have requested authorities to consider providing an additional toilet for OCD patients,“ he said.Legendary figures like Prot estant leader Martin Luther, author John Bunyan, litterateur Samuel Johnson and naturalist Charles Darwin suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder. In early 14th century, it was believed in Europe that those stuck in the cycle of obsessive thoughts were possessed by evil forces. Sigmund Freud, in early 20th century, attributed obsessive compulsive behaviour to unconscious conflicts manifesting as typical symptoms. He described the problem of frequent washing of hands as touching phobia.The obsessive and compulsive spectrum includes hair pulling, skin picking and body dysmorphic disorders. “There are some who keep pulling their hair and eyebrows. It’s called Trichotellomania.The patient is completely aware of the condition but is unable to overcome it.Some suffer from skin picking disorder, a rare condition. We had an 18-year-old female patient who would constantly scratch and pinch her skin. She would try to level the skin. Some of the models too suffer from the problem,” said Dr Shyam Sundar, associate professor of psychiatry at Nimhans who works in the OCD clinic.A 20-year-old woman from Tamil Nadu was upset with her skin colour and kept applying creams on her face to get fair.“She suffered from body dysmorphic disorder, another kind of OCD, and suffered burning sensations owing to constant application of cream on her face,” said Dr Sundar.Research to trace OCD’s roots to the brain in underway. Nimhans is involved in the research along with experts from the US, the Netherlands, South Africa and Brazil. All the five centres chosen for research will follow uniform protocol to understand the biology of illness. The research is funded by the National Institute of Mental Health in the US."
"Commuter feels needle prick, arm goes numb",2017-11-19,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News,Crime News","MUMBAI: In a chilling incident, a 49-year-old woman from Badlapur claims to have been punctured by a needle that numbed her left arm for days together. The incident, which took place at Dadar station during the evening peak hour of November 2, has shaken the commuter of 20 years. She is now living under the fear of having contracted a deadly infection.The woman who did not wish to be identified told TOI on Saturday that she decided to speak up only so that other women commuters become more alert during their train rides. On November 2, the woman recalled, she was crossing over from the western side of Dadar’s platform number two to catch a train home when she felt a sharp stinging sensation on her left shoulder. “When I looked over, a stranger apologized and went ahead in a hurry. It was only after some time that I spotted a tiny dot of blood on my sleeve. There was shooting pain and a burning sensation.”She felt nothing more during her two-hour-long homebound journey though. The only thing she witnessed was a slit mark on the strap of her handbag. She said the effect of the “prick” kicked in after she reached home around 9pm and went to wash her hands. “I could not feel my left arm at all. As I poured soap and water, there was no sensation. It was as if I didn’t have a left arm. That’s when I thought of the needle prick and how I could have been injected with some drug,” she said. While she wanted to rush to a doctor, her husband reasoned that she was being panicky and that it would subside soon.The victim did not consult a doctor till the next afternoon when a physician organizing a health camp at her office in Vile Parle, noticed that her left arm was indeed swollen. That Friday, she left office early to consult Dr Jeetendra Chandarkar, a surgeon in Badlapur. The woman said she had approached a constable at the platform but was told to lodge an online complaint. “When I tried to do that, he told me it was not the right place to lodge a complaint. I didn’t have the energy to pursue it,” she said. The family has not yet registered a formal complaint.She thinks the person’s intention was to snatch her handbag while she grappled with the lack of sensation.When TOI contacted him, Dr Chandarkar said, “By the time she came to me, she had regained her arm’s movement and had no visible needle prick marks.” Over the next few days, she also developed a pain on the right shoulder and arm, which the doctor said was related to spondylitis and not to the alleged incident. He added, “There are some drugs that can paralyze skeletal muscles temporarily. It is quite possible that someone could have got access to anaesthesia drugs and played the mischief.” The victim said her bigger fear now was whether she has contracted any serious infection. “I asked for an n HIV test but the doctor said there was a window period before which my test results could show false negativity.” The woman plans to resume work on Monday. Sources in RPF said that they have never received any complaints of this nature."
PGI: Lack of medicines: HIV +ve coming to PGI at ART risk,2017-11-23,CHANDIGARH,"News,City News,Chandigarh News","CHANDIGARH: Around 300 HIV positive people coming to PGIMER are at risk of progressing to the third line antiretroviral therapy (ART) – a critical stage of the virus infection—for want of medicines.HIV positive people are registered for second line ART in PGIMER, Chandigarh, which caters to Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh , Haryana, Punjab, Dehradun and Chandigarh. PGI is one of the centres of excellence for ART, north of Delhi.“We have been coming across cases where patients have not got medicines for the past three months. Every day, two to three persons come to my office to raise the issue of non-availability of medicines. Most of them have been discontinued,” said Pooja Thakur, an HIV activist from Chandigarh.Experts said missing doses, especially when a patient is on second line of treatment, can be very risky. “We have been facing shortage of these medicines for a while, however, this is being resolved. We have tied up with the Punjab State AIDS Control Society, which will give us the medicines. We had been facing the problem for a few days due to cash crunch from NACO,” said Dr Vanita Gupta, project director, Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (SACS). She also said they would reimburse patients who buy medicines from the market.Countering the version of SACS officials, Pooja said, “The total amount for second line ART amounts to around Rs 5,000 per month. This is unaffordable. How can anyone take a reimbursement when there is no paying capacity?”Out of the 300 patients getting second line treatment from PGI, 30 are from Chandigarh, 90 from Haryana and 120 from Punjab. SACS, which is supposed to procure medicines, blames NACO for the situation, while NACO officials feel otherwise. “We supplied drugs to Punjab a few days ago. There is no shortage of funds from NACO. In fact, it is the responsibility of SACS to provide these medicines,” said Dr J S Malhi, regional coordinator, NACO.According to the Network of People living with HIV/Aids, Chandigarh, second line treatment drugs which are out of stock include Lamivudine, Zidovudine and Abacavir. These medicines are supposed to be given in combination. Missing even one renders the course incomplete. “Even children face the same problem. There are 30 children registered with PGIMER’s ART for second line treatment,” said a doctor at PGIMER."
Experimental vaccine may protect against HIV,2017-10-29,WASHINGTON,News,"WASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a novel vaccine candidate that may prevent HIV infection by stimulating an immune response against sugars that form a protective shield around the virus.""An obstacle to creating an effective HIV vaccine is the difficulty of getting the immune system to generate antibodies against the sugar shield of multiple HIV strains,"" said Lai-Xi Wang, a professor at University of Maryland in the US.""Our method addresses this problem by designing a vaccine component that mimics a protein-sugar part of this shield,"" said Wang.Researchers designed a vaccine candidate using an HIV protein fragment linked to a sugar group. When injected into rabbits, the vaccine candidate stimulated antibody responses against the sugar shield in four different HIV strains.The protein fragment of the vaccine candidate comes from gp120, a protein that covers HIV like a protective envelope.A sugar shield covers the gp120 envelope, bolstering HIV's defenses. The rare HIV-infected individuals who can keep the virus at bay without medication typically have antibodies that attack gp120.Researchers have tried to create an HIV vaccine targeting gp120, but had little success as the sugar shield on HIV resembles sugars found in the human body and therefore does not stimulate a strong immune response.More than 60 strains of HIV exist and the virus mutates frequently. As a result, antibodies against gp120 from one HIV strain will not protect against other strains.To overcome these challenges, researchers focused on a small fragment of gp120 protein that is common among HIV strains.They used a synthetic chemistry to combine the gp120 fragment with a sugar molecule, also shared among HIV strains, to mimic the sugar shield on the HIV envelope.Researchers then injected the protein-sugar vaccine candidate into rabbits and found that the rabbits' immune systems produced antibodies that physically bound to gp120 found in four dominant strains of HIV in circulation today.Injecting rabbits with a vaccine candidate that contained the protein fragment without the sugar group resulted in antibodies that primarily bound to gp120 from only one HIV strain.""This result was significant because producing antibodies that directly target the defensive sugar shield is an important step in developing immunity against the target and therefore the first step in developing a truly effective vaccine,"" Wang said.Although the rabbits' antibodies bound to gp120, they did not prevent live HIV from infecting cells. This result did not surprise Wang, who noted that it usually takes humans up to two years to build immunity against HIV and the animal study only lasted two months.""But the ability of the vaccine candidate to raise substantial antibodies against the sugar shield in only two months is encouraging,"" Wang said.""Other studies took up to four years to achieve similar results. This means that our molecule is a relatively strong inducer of the immune response,"" he said."

The chief development officer (Allahabad) Samual N Pal’s unbeaten 58 helped the team to put up a tough challenge for their opponents.The team of HIV positive and AIDS patients could manage to score only 38 runs and were bowled out at the end of the match. However, the prize money for the match was given to the team of HIV positive players.The participating government officials said the cricket match sends a clear message that people diagnosed with HIV or AIDS are competent enough to do whatever they want in their lives.The match was organised by the District Aids Prevention & Control Unit (DAPCU) with the support of the district administration on Sunday and plans to organise more such tournaments.District programme manager of DAPCU, Dr Rohit Pandey said, “It’s a small effort which indicated that HIV+ people should not be discriminated against with and the society should support them. Sports especially cricket could be a great medium to create awareness among masses and bust myths associated with co-habitation with AIDS\HIV patients.”The 11-member team of HIV+ patients was selected by the Uttar Pradesh Welfare for People Living with HIV/AIDS Society (UPNPplus), an organization which works for the welfare of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV).A DAPCU official, preferring anonymity, said, “If equal opportunities are given, people living HIV and AIDS can excel in any field. While interacting with them, we advised them to take their medicines regularly and lead a normal life.”“There is a strong need to do away with the misconceptions about AIDS and the stigma and discrimination asosciated with people diagnosed with the condition. Sunday’s match will set an example of the love and courage displayed by HIV positive patients. It will show the society that we are able to achieve our dreams like others.” said an HIV positive player, who participated in the match."
Absence of palliative care bitter pill to swallow for terminally ill patients,2017-10-16,VISAKHAPATNAM,"News,City News,Visakhapatnam News","VISAKHAPATNAM: The stark absence of awareness on palliative care of terminally ill patients was brought into focus on World Hospice and Palliative Care Day, which was observed on October 14.The day is dedicated to the care and pain management of terminally-ill patients with a short lifespan and the chronically ill who suffer from severe pain.Awareness about palliative care is scarce and centres or hospices (place for treatment of the terminally ill or those suffering from painful chronic illness) are hardly found in the district or state.In India, 60-70% of cancer cases are detected at advanced stages and there often comes a time when chemotherapy no longer works and patients in extreme pain are sent back home as nothing more can be done. Not only terminally ill cancer patients, but also chronically ill kidney patients undergoing dialysis, chronic liver disease, paralytic stroke, HIV, dementia too require pain management medication and care, which includes physical, psycho-social, emotional and spiritual care.Given the situation, there is a need for such palliative care units, say medical experts and philanthropic organisations. Currently, such a hospice ward is run only in St Joseph’s Hospital at ZP Junction in collaboration with an NGO Age Care Foundation.Dr Vidya Vishwanath, who works with Homi Bhaba Cancer Hospital and is trained in palliative care, said, “Both terminally ill cancer patients and certain non-cancer chronically ill cases require palliative care at some point of time but people are unaware about the importance of pain management and medication. All such care cannot be taken at home, when the patients have difficulty in eating or swallowing or require oxygen or when caregivers at home are exhausted or there is nobody to take care of them. Patients can also be in and out of the hospice depending on their condition.When the pain becomes excruciating and their conditions worsen, they can be sent to the palliative care unit and when they are better, they can be sent home. Thus, they will not feel abandoned.”Another aspect of pain management is availability of opioids or morphine as the key pain alleviating medicine. “Under the amended Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, with a special NDPS licence, hospitals can procure the morphine for pain management cases. It’s also difficult for the terminally or chronically ill patients to travel hundreds of kilometres to procure morphine for pain management. So if peripheral centres are set up, patients will not be denied pain medication. There needs to be social awareness, government policies and resources plus trained manpower in this direction (including palliative care doctors, nurses, social works and counsellors), so that in the peripheries such centres are set up as well,” added Dr Vishwanath.The region’s only exclusive palliative care ward, consisting of seven beds at St Joseph’s Hospital, is always occupied by terminally ill patients who may live for a few days to a few weeks. Patients from neighbouring states and districts – in the age group of 10-75 years are also housed there. While it is leukaemia and bone cancer in children adults are mostly afflicted by stomach, lung, head and neck and breast cancer.Supraja Borthwick, Hospice coordinator at St Joseph’s Hospital and Trustee of Age Care Foundation that funds the hospice said, “The aim is to make the last days of the patients comfortable, by helping in their pain management and improving their quality of life. For instance, a stomach cancer patient would be suffering from constipation, vomiting, eating and breathing difficulty and cannot be managed at home. We also gradually prepare the family and the patient to accept the inevitable and try to ensure the patient is not isolated but rather gets to spend quality time with family.”"

Socially responsible youth celebrate Diwali with HIV-affected children,2017-10-18,Madurai,"News,City News,Madurai News","Madurai: Diwali is a festival of lights and pomp. People of all walks of life make it a point to celebrate this festival. With increasing social concerns, people prefer to lace their celebrations with a good deed. A group of like-minded people started working a fortnight ahead of Diwali to collate whatever they could like money and clothes and distribute them among the orphans and elderly. This year too, they collected the materials but there was a certain delay due to GST and finances were tight.Padikattugal, a youth forum in the city distributed clothes and sweets to children affected with HIV. They have been doing it for last five years. For the past three years, they set up a stall in one of the textile showrooms to collect money or clothes from people shopping in the textiles outlet. After required money is mobilised, they take the children from orphanages for shopping before the shop opens for public. This year, however, there was considerable delay in collating money and clothes. “We could not take children for shopping. Most of them donate food on Diwali days, but clothes, sweets and crackers make their Diwali which is the reason we collect these goodies for them,” said S Malaisamy, managing trustee of Padikattugal.In spite of financial constraints, generosity of willing public surpasses the difficulties, quipped V P Manikandan, a social worker in the city. “It is true that money was tight this year but good-hearted people do contribute whatever they can”, he mentioned. On Wednesday, Manikandan along with volunteers and social workers will be visiting couple of orphanages and old age homes to celebrate Deepavali . “More than goodies, the rejected lot of society enjoy company of people. There are some to remember them”, he added.Even ahead of Diwali, a group of transgenders celebrated the festival with the corporation home for destitutes at Uthangudi. As many as 150 students from Maharishi Vidhya Mandir School, Kovilpappakudi decided to celebrate the festival with differently-abled children. On Monday, they visited Able Kids Special School at Arapalayam. They conducted cultural programmes for these special children and they had a great time together."

India saw 2.5 million deaths due to pollution in 2015: Study,2017-10-21,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: India has topped the list of countries with the most pollution-related deaths in 2015, with 2.5 million mortalities linked to air, water and other types of pollution, a latest report by international journal Lancet shows.It also topped the list of deaths linked to polluted air (1.81 million) and water (0.64 million). The figure of number of deaths due to air pollution , compiled by the Lancet study , is, in fact, over 7,00,000 more than what an another international report, State of Global Air (SGA) 2017, had come out with earlier this year.The SGA 2017 report had put this figure (deaths due to air pollution) for India at 10,90,400 deaths as compared to 11,08,100 in China.The differences in figures of the two reports can be attributed to the different set of data and parameters used by them. The SGA report had taken fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) as a prime measure. The Lancet report, however, is based on data from the Global Burden of Disease study which analysed multiple parameters over two years to arrive at the figures.Accordingly, the Lancet study noted that foul air was linked to 6.5 million deaths worldwide whereas the SGA report put this figure at 4.2 million.According to the Lancet study, released on Thursday, India accounted for about 28% of an estimated nine million pollution-linked deaths worldwide in 2015, highlighting the alarming increase in the burden of diseases as well as mortality from different types of pollution.China follows India on the list, accounting for 1.8 million deaths due to air, water and other types of pollution. In fact, 92% of pollution-related deaths were reported in low- and middle-income countries, and in rapidly industrialising nations such as India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Madagascar and Kenya, the study said.The Lancet report shows most of these deaths were due to non-communicable diseases caused by pollution, such as heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In fact, pollution is now the largest environmental cause of disease and death in the world, accounting for almost three times more of those than from HIV-AIDS, TB and malaria put together.The Lancet study has also arrived at a financial cost from pollution-related deaths, saying it totalled some $4.6 trillion, which is about 6.2% of the global economy. It says the costs of pollution-related death and disease are highly concentrated in developing regions, equivalent to around 1.3% of the GDP in low-income countries, compared to around 0.5% GDP in high-income countries, and 0.13% GDP globally.Experts say the huge population of countries like India and China and the fact that these are developing economies should also be kept in mind while analysing these statistics. “There is no denial that mortality from diseases linked with pollution is high in our country. The burden of deaths due to respiratory diseases itself is high, accounting for almost 26% of the total non-communicable diseases, which accounts for 60% of the total deaths in the country,” a health ministry official said.To tackle the problem, the health ministry had formed two committees — a steering committee and a multi-sectoral group — to analyse the trend and suggest actions to reduce pollution and its impact, as well as measures to strengthen the healthcare system to handle the increasing disease burden linked with pollution.“We have already started taking action based on the recommendations made by the two groups. For instance, we have now included respiratory diseases under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke. We have also allocated funds to states for the same,” the official said.Among the authors of the study are former environment minister Jairam Ramesh and IIT-Delhi’s Prof Mukesh Khare. The report was prepared by the Lancet commission on pollution and health under a two-year project that involved more than 40 international health and environmental authors.The report sees the authors argue that pollution is not the inevitable consequence of economic development, and applying similar legislation and regulation from high-income countries to low- and middle-income countries could help improve and protect health as countries develop."

She is the daughter of Dr M S Swaminathan, who is known as the father of India’s green revolution. On Monday, she was felicitated by The Rotary Club of Madras East.Delivering the Power Series Talk, Dr Swaminathan spoke about dengue, TB and other health issues in India. “Dengue is a disease where the mosquito breeds inside our homes or just around. The government cannot come into each house and check to see where the mosquito is breeding. Every small plastic object thrown somewhere can become a potential mosquito breeding site,” she said.She added that combating dengue “has to be a people’s movement . We have to keep our surroundings clean and cannot expect the government to come and keep cleaning up. School children need to get involved in this.”She also spoke about the ‘TB Free Chennai’ programme, aimed at eradicating tuberculosis in the city, a movement for which the public and private sector will work together. Recalling the fight against polio, she said that any large movement like this “requires a partnership” between the government, civil society, social service organisations, the media, big funders and science.“Tuberculosis is a huge, global problem. India has the largest burden of TB; there can be no global elimination without India making a big dent,” she said. She added, “Of the ten million new cases every year, we are contributing at least three million. A third of the world’s TB cases are in India. The biggest risk factor for TB today is malnutrition, it’s not HIV”.“Mobilisation of people becomes important for any large public health programme,” she said."

Telling stories of the earth,2017-11-05,Chennai,"News,City News,Chennai News","Chennai: In the forests, up in the hills near Chalakudy in Kerala, Santosh Sivan waits with his camera and crew for the peacock to make its proud entrance, for it’s a magnificent sight. But Sivan knows it’s a poignant moment as well, when he is informed the peacock has come. For, according to the people who inhabit the hills, it’s also a sign of global warming.And that’s what the award-winning cinematographer-director has been doing in Kerala the past few days — documenting the effects of man versus nature. ""The locals here say the peacock was never seen in the high mountain ranges, but it has started inhabiting the place because it has become warmer,"" says Sivan.It’s what he loves doing between films, says Sivan. ""Whenever I get free time between my commercial assignments, you will find me in some forest, hill or village somewhere in India, engaging with nature. I do it on my own time, and usually on my own funding because it’s something I like, need and want to do,"" says Sivan, who is shooting his documentary on global warming, ‘The Peacock Has Come’ before he gets started on the cinematography for Mani Ratnam’s movie in January, and then the direction of his next film ‘Kunjali Marakkar’, starring Malayalam actor Mammootty.‘The Peacock Has Come’, which should be in post-production after next summer, is based on a study done on the impact of man-made modifications on the Chalakudy river systems and the vanishing of the rainforest ecosystem.In his three-decade film career, Sivan has worked on 45 movies and an almost equal number of documentaries on topics that range from health and environment to social issues, to one following the journey of an elephant from Kerala to Halifax in Canada, including its first steps on ice. ""The elephant made the journey six decades before we made the film but we documented the footsteps of the elephant as it was loved by the Canadians, who were grief-stricken when it died,"" says Sivan.The 53-year-old’s 2007 release, ‘Prarambha’, which dealt with the stigma attached to a young boy living with HIV, won the national film award for Best Educational/Motivational/Instructional Film.""I feel that as a cinematographer I am connected to the environment, to weather, to climate. And I find that when I document changes in the environment it enhances my perception and connection with the world around me. It enriches my view of the world and I bring that out in my other projects as well,"" says Sivan, whose last documentary was two-and-a-half years ago on how urbanisation has impacted the farmers of Kuttanad, Kerala. ""It feels like it was too long ago, that’s why I wanted to get back in touch with nature,"" says Sivan."
A forgotten art of telling tales of yore via paintings,2017-11-05,PUNE,"News,City News,Pune News","PUNE: For decades, the Thakar community worked as spies for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj . They performed puppet shows across towns, gathered information about peasants’ opinion of the king and conveyed the same to him.Centuries later, they still continue with the art of telling stories but through paintings. These artists, known as Chitrakathi, perform through 30-35 sequential paintings, depicting various incidents in Ramayana and Mahabharata.They tell stories of abduction of Sita by Ravana, Ram and Laxman’s quest to trace Sita, Jatayu’s attempts to save her, Hanuman’s campaign to locate her, and more.Pinguli in lush-green Sindhudurg district is home to the current generation of Chitrakathi artists whose ancestors had worked for Shivaji Maharaj.Chetan Gangavane (29), a trained engineer and the 12th generation artist in his family, has been continuing with the art of Chitrakathi. He is currently in the city for the Dastakar Haat exhibition at Monalisa Kalagram. Like every teenager in the village, Chetan too laid emphasis on education and started working in a Mumbai-based firm.However, his life took a U-turn in 2016 when he came home on a holiday. “During that time we received a contract from the government for spreading awareness about HIV-AIDS through 100 puppet shows.The amount I was paid for this equalled my annual package. The monetary benefits and the need for saving the art made me quit my job,” said Chetan, who has been practising Chitrakathi from 2007.Chetan and his elder brother Eknath Gangavane are among the very few artists who practise Chitrakathi. Pinguli’s proximity to the city of Kudal encouraged many youths to receive education and take up day jobs. Chetan’s grandfather was among the first batch to pass out of IIT Powai Once the artisans of Chitrakathi were treated with respect but after the power of princely states waned, the art was reduced to beggary. “This forced subsequent generations to give up art and start looking for employment opportunities,” he said.However, Gangavanes were adamant on preserving the art. Chetan’s father Parshuram Gangavane set up a Chitrakathi museum in Pinguli called Thakar Adivasi Kala Angan and Art Museum.The family also practises puppetry, which is called ‘Kalsutri Bahulya’. To popularise the art in all strata of society, Chetan and his brother have started depicting Chitrakathi on postcards, teapots, keychains, bookmarks and frames. “This has helped us to spread our art to a lot more people than what the sales of paintings could do,” he said."
"At 330, more swine flu cases than 2014-15 outbreak",2017-11-05,NAGPUR,"News,City News,Nagpur News","NAGPUR: This year, the rate of positive swine flu cases has broken all past records. It has surpassed the virus outbreak that occurred in 2014-15 too.Totally, 330 positive cases have been reported in the city till 5pm on Friday. The numbers are likely to go up as December to February is considered as peak season for swine flu. Between April 2014 and March 2015 (the records are maintained for the financial year), there were 325 cases.However, as compared to 2014-15 when 55 people succumbed to the virus, this year there have been only 37 deaths. Between January and March this year, 20 positive cases and three deaths were registered. If the calendar year is considered, there have been 350 positive cases and 40 deaths.Despite the high number, the health department says it cannot be termed as an “outbreak”. Virus experts TOI spoke to were hesitant to comment on government policies.But virologist Dr Ashwini Tayde said everyone should start taking precautions and get vaccinated. “Vaccines are ignored. We see young patients dying of swine flu but vaccines are not given importance,” she said.The health official said that an outbreak, if any, is declared by the state surveillance office in Mumbai. According to him, an outbreak is declared only when five or more positive cases are recorded from a locality with all being from the same period.This year the flu has been recorded every month regardless of the season. “Earlier, the virus prevailed only during winter. Also, the cases are coming from different parts of the city and not from specific localities,” said the health official.As per the data of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), 24 cases were reported in April, 17 in May, 7 in June, 14 in July and 10 in August. From September 1 till date, totally 238 deaths were recorded, which makes up for 72% of the cases recorded since April.Another health official said going by the average of 16 positive cases per month, he expects 80 cases to be registered till March next year.“We cannot term it as an epidemic as the flu is present throughout the year.

Sacked `whistleblower' real culprit: IndiGo,2017-11-09,NEW DELHI,"News,City News,Delhi News","NEW DELHI: The controversy over IndiGo staffers manhandling and dragging a flyer at Delhi airport on October 15 took a new turn on Wednesday with the airline telling the government that its sacked `whistleblower' employee had `instigated' the entire episode. The airline said the staffer blamed for manhandling flyer Rajiv Katyal , who had flown in from Chennai on 6E 487, was trying to prevent Katyal from harm near the jet and just doing his job.IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh said this in a detailed report submitted to the aviation ministry on Wednesday while “acknowledging we were at fault... apologise for this regrettable incident... have also taken action (suspended peo ple pending probe)“. Giving the airline's version, Ghosh writes: “The ex-employee Montu Kalra, who was terminated and is claiming to be the `whistleblower', is the one you hear shouting in the video.“ IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh said, “The ex-em ployee, Montu Kalra, is the one you can hear instructing the other two colleagues who were junior to him to prevent the customer from boarding the bus and holding him back at the ramp itself... He instigated the incident and further provoked the customer by beginning to shoot a video on his mobile phone... Kalra was not terminated because he either shot a video or as he is now claiming brought this to our attention,“ Ghosh's letter says.Airline staff stop passengers from getting near any live ground equipment to avoid hurting themselves. “When our staff Juby Thomas saw Mr Katyal inadvertently mov ing towards the catering highlift (which was attached to the aircraft), Thomas started waving frantically from a distance to ask Mr Katyal to move away with the sole intention of preventing any accident,“ Ghosh's report said, adding that Thomas started shouting to be heard by the passenger due to the high aircraft noise.“It is possible that due to the very noisy ramp area, Mr Katyal could not hear Juby Thomas properly and ... may have felt Thomas was being rude. The reality is that Juby Thomas was only trying to ensure the safety of Mr Katyal and prevent an accident,“ the letter says.It adds that Katyal was “irritated and irate“. “it seems Mr Katyal asked Juby Thomas to `f*** *ff '... Thomas turned around and asked Mr Katyal why he is abusing him.“ After this the airline gives a sequence of events with pictures from the now-viral video clip which are as follows: First, “Montu Kalra is shouting at the two employees who are junior to him and instructing them to prevent Mr Katyal from boarding the bus.“ While Thomas asks Katyal not to board the bus, another ground staffer, Sahiv Sharma, asks the driver to drive the bus away . At this time, the passenger is arguing with Thomas and trying to enter the bus.When the bus doors closed, IndiGo report says, “Katyal reached out and grabs Juby's (who is keeping a safe distance) face.“ “Even while Juby Thomas is being assaulted, Thomas does not retaliate and Sa hiv Sharma (the other ground staffer) tries to separate the two by embracing Mr Katyal from the back and escorting him away.... Even after Mr Katyal is separated from Thomas, he once again charged towards him and grabbed Thomas' face... in the process both of them lose balance and fall to the ground.... Thomas (tries) to move away while he continues to get assaulted. “ Ghosh accepts that he wishes the `regrettable' situation was “handled differently“.“Whatever may have been the provocation, whether verbal or physical abuse, we could have tried to display more restraint.“ He adds that he apologised to the customer “the very same night“ and assured him of a thorough probe. The employees were suspended."

When positives attract,2017-11-11,Chennai,"News,City News,Chennai News","Chennai: Like many Indian couples, Karthik and Manu have an ""arranged love"" marriage. Only, in their case, it’s not horoscopes but white blood cell counts (CD4) that were matched. And the one who played matchmaker was none other than the India's pioneering crusader against AIDS, late Dr Suniti Solomon.Through the unconventional love story of Karthik and Manu, the 74-minute documentary ‘Lovesick’ explores an important question — in India, where marriage is a must but HIV/AIDS taboo, how do patients find a partner? ‘Lovesick’, which will have its world premiere at the DOC NYC film festival on November 15, hopes to give voice to the millions who live in the shadows, afraid that the revelation of their HIV status will ruin their job prospects, end their hopes for a loving relationship or shame their families.Filmmakers Ann S Kim and Priya Giri Desai were inspired to make the documentary after reading about Dr Solomon’s work. ""We were struck by her work and how under the radar it was, even though she was touching on so many hot-button points that are still debated — the role of science, the pull of tradition and cultural expectations,"" says Kim.Dr Solomon documented the first cases of HIV in India in 1986 among sex workers when she was a professor of microbiology at Madras Medical College, where she also formed India’s first AIDS resource group. In 1993, she took voluntary retirement to establish YRG CARE.In the latter part of her career, she began helping healthy patients find life partners.""In the beginning, patients didn’t survive for long. But with generic anti-retroviral medications, people began living longer and faced the pressure at home to get married,"" says Sunil Solomon, chairman of YRG Foundation, adding that many hadn’t told their parents they were HIV positive . ""Since they didn’t want to ruin the lives of others by getting married to them, they would come to us for help.""Kim and Desai made their first trip to India in 2008, and met Dr Solomon. Production for the film began in 2009 and was completed in 2017. ""We worked with YRG CARE to find patients willing to tell their stories,"" says Desai.They met Karthik, 38, who contracted the disease after he met with an accident and had a blood transfusion during surgery. ‘Lovesick’, which interspersesDr Solomon’s own love story while tracing Karthik’s quest for a life partner, moves back and forth among the doctor, Karthik, and Manu, a divorced woman in her 30s, who was infected by herex-husband.‘Lovesick’, in its very narration, differs from other documentaries on HIV/AIDS. ""We often think of HIV/AIDS stories as gloomy, but this story is a testament to the power of social connection,"" says Kim. In the film, Dr Solomon talks about how, once patients find companions, their CD4 counts go up and viral loads come down.However, matchmaking is no easy feat as the criteria of caste, community, religion, education, skin colour all apply. ""They have all the requirements that a non-HIV positive male would ask for —that the girl be fair, tall and slim,"" says Sunil, adding that many men are particular that the woman should not have contracted the infection through sexual intercourse. ""Our organisation has brought together 25 couples so far, with the first marriage — of a Tamil man and Marathi woman — in July 2001,"" says Sunil.The filmmakers hope the film will help people working with HIV affected — researchers, clinicians, support groups — to show that life after positive diagnosis can be filled with hope and happiness.""We hope ‘Lovesick’ continues the conversation around HIV/AIDS. It’s hard to hear about the faceless millions afflicted with yet another incurable disease but it is inspiring to hear about how people triumph in the face of that adversity,"" says Desai."
"From 3 times a week, TB drugs to be administered daily",2017-11-12,Dehradun,"News,City News,Dehradun News","Dehradun: A little more than a month after government authorities said that Uttarakhand will be made free from Tuberculosis (TB) by 2025, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, on Sunday, rolled out a daily drug regimen for treating those afflicted with the disease.

He also said that considering the level of awareness in the state, this target could be achieved by 2024. The CM also distributed drugs to some TB patients present at the event.State tuberculosis control officer, Dr B C Kala, said, “With a large number of people suffering from HIV and drug resistant TB, the fight to control it has proved difficult. Under DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short course) program, treatment was given three times a week by government agencies even as private hospitals had already shifted to the daily dosage procedure.”“One should not get scared or hide the disease from their loved ones. Scientists have won the battle against TB. More awareness is now required so that people contact a doctor immediately and take the prescribed medicines,” said Rawat."

Blood banks run out of HIV kits,2017-11-15,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: After a blood crisis, several banks in the city have now been hit by a shortage of testing kits for HIV/AIDS. In the absence of testing kits, blood that has been collected from donors cannot be utilized for patients.The public blood banks in the city get their testing kits from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), which purchases them centrally. In November, most blood banks have not received their supply and are scrambling to make last-minute purchases locally.It is feared that the existing shortage of blood in the city may be aggravated by the lack of testing kits as even if blood is collected it cannot be given to patients without certifying it as infection-free.Staffers from several blood banks, including Cama and Albless, St George, GT, have confirmed that they have run out of testing kits. Dean of Parel’s KEM Hospital Dr Avinash Supe said that since the kits have not come, they have purchased locally.The Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) distributes kits on behalf of the NACO to the city blood banks. Supe said, “MDACS has not provided us kits. We have made purchases and have adequate stock now,” he said. KEM’s blood bank collects over 12,000 units of blood annually, the highest in the city. Dr Shrikala Acharya, assistant project director of the MDACS , confirmed that the kits have not arrived from NACO."
This Mangaluru youth has been sharing a smile across country,2017-11-13,MANGALURU,"News,City News,Mangalore News","MANGALURU: When a visually impaired youth had lost all hope in life and was clueless about his future, a group of young volunteers not only helped him complete his education but also became his scribe in the exam. Thanks to the help of these youngsters, the youth is now a second division officer in the agriculture department.In another case, when a small-time farmer was struggling to arrange money for his three-month-old kid’s open heart surgery, a few youths came as messiahs in his life and helped him arrange funds for the surgery. The farmer and his wife were blessed with this kid after six years of marriage. Nine months down the line, the kid is hale and hearty and is gearing up to start his schooling.These are two of the numerous changes a youth from Mangaluru and his team have brought about in the lives of the less privileged and the destitute across the country.Mohammed Iliyas, 34, better known as Sameer, hailing from Bantwal in Dakshina Kannada , shifted to Bengaluru in 2004 because of his job in the financial sector there. He was happy as he got to visit NGOs and render service as part of his company’s Corporate Social Responsibility CSR ) activity. However, he soon realised that there were several low-profiled and less noticed NGOs that were desperately looking for some external help. Sameer felt the urge to reach out to such NGOs and their inmates. He knew realising his dream was an uphill task. However, he was not the one to give up.On May 3, 2016, Sameer created ‘Share a Smile’, a WhatsApp group and added a few friends to it. Though he did not elicit good response, Sameer alone took forward the cause. He continued working on the weekdays in the corporate sector, but dedicated a good part of his weekends to serve the society. Eighteen months down the line, Share a Smile caters to 1,300 victims of destiny, with 118 volunteers and four branches across the country. Sameer, who set up his first branch in Bengaluru, extended his campaign to Hyderabad in February 2017 and Kolkata in May. Share a Smile began its fourth branch in Delhi this Saturday and held its first event in the national capital on Sunday.The 1,300 victims that Share a Smile caters to are kids thrown in dustbins, HIV infected children, women who have lost their sanity because of assaults from their husbands and victims of gang rape, among others.Sameer says he has found the kindest of people in Bengaluru who have so far contributed immensely in his team’s services. “We do not provide help in cash to the NGOs as there are chances of misuse. Whatever help we needed, such as grocery and clothes, we got, and have been getting, from the donors in Bengaluru. Their help is one of the reasons that motivated I expand the initiative to other cities.”Sameer and his team have also been spending a good percentage of their salary in sharing smiles on thousands of innocent faces, thereby telling them they are not alone."
"Needle jabs pose risk for health workers, patients",2017-11-14,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News","CHENNAI: Surgical students and nurses are often accidentally jabbed by needles, but rarely do they report these injuries. A healthcare worker pierced by a needle is at risk of contracting infections such as hepatitis, HIV or syphilis. Though WHO estimates that 37.6% of hepatitis B infections in healthcare workers are due to needlestick injuries, there is no reporting protocol at state-run hospitals and doctors’ bodies are dubbing it a ""silent epidemic"" among health workers Inadvertent needlestick injuries are a concern to both doctor and patient. A healthcare worker’s blood-borne illness may expose patients to infections. Yet, the state health department does not have a record of the number of employees who suffered needle pricks.The issue came into focus after a study was published by Indian Ophthalmic Journal, on Sankara Nethralaya , a tertiary eyecare hospital, last month. Data showed there were 140 needlestick injuries between 2010 and 2015 in the hospital. Of those injured, 24% were ophthalmic fellows under training, followed by nursing staff (23%) and consultants (21%). The highest incidence was found in the operating room (67%), mostly while passing sharp instruments.Although doctors say the small, sharp instruments used by eye surgeons put them at high risk, incidents in operation theatres and emergency rooms of other tertiary care hospitals are no fewer. In 2011, Apollo Hospitals reported 118 needlestick injuries in 30 months, of which 17 cases related to patients with hepatitis B, nine to HIV, and eight to hepatitis C. The hospital’s infectious diseases department maintains a register and monitors health workers who report needle stick injuries.But doctors at government hospitals have no such system. Low vaccination rates and poor awareness about handling sharp instruments make medical staff susceptible to infections. TN Government Doctors’ Association had urged the state to fund surgery for at least three government doctors who underwent treatment, including liver transplants, after they contracted hepatitis through needle pricks.""Doctors don’t get preventive vaccines on time or financial aid when they are infected. If this is the situation for doctors, it could be worse for paramedical and housekeeping staff,"" said TN Government Doctors’ Association president Dr K Senthil . ""We desperately need a protocol for needlestick injuries for health workers,"" he said.If a patient is suspected to have hepatitis B, the protocol is to administer medical staffers with hepatitis B immune globulin post exposure to the patient. ""If they know or suspect that the patient has HIV, they collect preventive medicine from the anti-retroviral centre,"" said director of medical education Dr A Edwin Joe. ""We don’t buy the medicine, but doctors can indent for it through the staff welfare fund,"" he said but did not have the number of people who purchased these medicines.TN AIDS Control Society, which runs free clinics, supplies post-exposure prophylaxis kits to staff who report these injuries. But many medicos and nurses told TOI that they ignore the pricks because medication came with side-effects such as abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and nausea. ""To be effective, full dosage of anti-viral HIV drugs must be taken immediately after injury. But when I took the medication, I could not get out of bed for two days. The patient had left the hospital and we did not know his HIV status. I stopped medicines but did not do a blood test,"" said a 27-year-old nurse."

HIV-positive cases on the rise in Assam,2017-11-29,GUWAHATI,"News,City News,Guwahati News,Civic Issues","GUWAHATI: The latest AIDS fact sheet released by Assam State Aids Control Society (ASACS) on Tuesday revealed a significant rise in the prevalence of HIV-positive cases in the men having sex with men ( MSM ) community. The cases have been increased to 2.40% as compared to 1.40% as it was from 2010-15.The MSM community comprises homosexual and bisexual men along with transgender people. It is considered to be a high risk group (HRG) for HIV-positive cases. The other members of the HRG group are female sex workers (FSW), drug users and long-distance truck drivers. The HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) data of 2017 showed that other HRGs such as intravenous drug users (IDU), FSWs, single male migrants (SMM), and ante natal clinic attendees (ANC) recorded HIV prevalence percentages of 0.69, 0.21, 0.00 and 0.16 respectively. The HSS, for the first time in Assam, also included long-distance truckers (LDT) who showed an HIV prevalence of 2.80%.""A recent study conducted in the US revealed that condom usage among the MSM community is low. In the last few years, it has also been observed that fewer people from the MSM community are using protection. Moreover, an increase in the intake of alcohol and drugs is also contributing to the problem,"" said SI Ahmed , a noted AIDS expert and founder of the NGO called AIDS Prevention Society. Ahmed added that the increase in percentage can be attributed to more people coming forward for HIV screening and getting detected in the process.The data in fact sheet, recorded till October 31, 2017, stated that 12737 people were detected HIV-positive out of the 12,62,601 who had been tested at integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) in the state. 11682 out of the 10,90,478 people tested had emerged HIV-positive last year. Similarly, there has been a rise of HIV cases among pregnant women this year. 1209 out of the 22,56,569 pregnant women tested have been detected HIV-positive this year as compared to the 1012 out of 17,08,918 last year. ""The reason why more people have been detected HIV-positive is due to the widespread screening process,"" said Varnali Deka , project director of ASACS. ""There is a high prevalence of HIV cases in Assam as it is surrounded by Manipur, Nagaland and Mizoram where the percentages are high,"" she added."
‘Data-sharing is vital to address public health issues’,2017-11-30,MUMBAI,,"MUMBAI: Recent efforts by the government to connect Aadhaar with health programmes , including HIV and TB care, have met with reactions ranging from hesitation to complete refusal from patients. But this attitude could witness a complete change if the state explains the opportunities and risks of sharing information with greater transparency, according to Michelle Williams dean of Harvard Chan School of Public Health , who is currently visiting the country.In an exclusive interaction with TOI on Wednesday, Williams, a renowned epidemiologist, emphasized the role that data plays in public health and how the contribution of population anWilliams cited the example of the US, where citizens have, over the years, opened up to the idea of sharing even their genomic history for the purpose of research and greater good. “That’s because institutions have managed to protect important personal records in ways that have encouraged people to share,” she said, adding the key is to communicate that the data is well-protected.She said the Harvard Chan School of Public Health that opened its research centre in the city two years ago also plans to collaborate to acquire, protect and analyze data from the Indian population.Dr Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, suggested stringent laws could also go a long way in instilling faith in people. “Until mid-90s, there was a real problem when people’s health data was sold. But bringing in laws besides a few high- profile prosecutions convinced people that violations would be dealt with strongly,” he said.Advocating better health communication, Williams said it will be an important tool to address issues of public health to maternal health to antibiotic resistance and even tackling the country’s emerging burden of non-communicable diseases.She said the institute, through its Mumbai base, would work with stakeholders to further understanding of public health. “People only think of public health when there is a zika or a chikungunya outbreak. So we have to explain the benefits of investing in prevention,” she said.Some of the other key areas where the institute intends to work with Indian partners is capacity building in mental health, the impact of climate change on health and trauma and resilience.“The impact of interpersonal domestic violence, war etc is borne by all, but women and girls in particular bear the brunt. The mental health component here is globally under-addressed,” said Williams. She added that the Harvard school may tie up with institutes such as the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) to train ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists). “No country in the world will ever have enough psychiatrists or psychologists so we need to create an auxiliary work force to provide community-based support,” she said."
Wearing helmets can prevent head injuries: Doctors,2017-11-30,NAGPUR,"News,City News,Nagpur News","NAGPUR: A large group of school students attended the head injury awareness campaign jointly organized by the Neurological Society of India (NSI) and Nagpur Neuro Society at a city hotel on Wednesday. The campaign was a part of the ‘Heads... We win’ program launched by NSI in 2013 and aimed to crusade for safe roads and make people vigilant towards importance of road safety.Senior neurosurgeons from around the nation like Dr CE Deopujaari and Suresh Sankhla from Mumbai, Dr VD Sinha from Jaipur and Dr Sumit Sinha from New Delhi guided the participants on various topics.Deopujari, who spoke about ‘traumatic brain and spine injury in India’, said, “Brain injuries are six times more common than breast cancer and ten times more common than HIV Aids. However, not much focus is on it.”“The countries that are showing economic improvement tend to neglect road safety measures in the national policies. It is essential that not only road laws need to be taken seriously but also tighter laws should be built for the construction work,” he added.Dr VD Sinha, while conveying the importance of helmets, told that head injury is the sixth common reason for death and it is largely caused as motorists do not wear helmets. He went at lengths on the topic and even gave a practical demonstration regarding how helmets have saved the head from serious injuries.That “India is called the trauma capital of the world” was disheartening new according to Dr Sumit Sinha. “It is mainly on the grounds of our ignorant attitude. Helmets and seat belts should be our routine when we begin to drive and one must understand that helmets decrease the impact of an injury about seven times. If the youngsters start following the protocols, the scenario can change at the earliest,” he said.Elements such as drunk driving, using phones while driving, speeding, overtaking and not wearing helmets and not fastening seat belts were criticized by all the speakers.DCP (traffic) Ravindra Sinh Pardeshi spoke briefly about how kids can put a positive pressure on their parents and people around them by asking them to follow the rules and regulations and by following them themselves too. “90% Nagpurians are now wearing helmets and seat belts. The awareness drives and stringent enforcement of rules has brought about some change,” he said.The programme concluded with a short skit by critical care specialist Dr Rajan Barokar and group which depicted the process that needs to be carried out when one notices an accident victim.Pardeshi, Barokar, Neeru Kapai, director of Modern School, Dr KS Rajan, district governor of Rotary International District 3030 and Dr Ashutosh Apte, partner of Rotary Club Nagpur West were felicitated during the programme by the hands of Dr VP Singh , secretary NSI. Dr Deepu Banerji, president of NSI also attended the event."
HIV-positive children in Goa finally get protection under RTE,2017-11-29,PANAJI,"News,City News,Goa News,Civic Issues","PANAJI: Goa has finally included children infected with or living with HIV as a disadvantaged section under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. This is expected to provide protection to these children from being denied admission and from being expelled from schools. In 2014, the plight of HIV-infected children in the state came to light when 13 HIV-infected orphans were expelled from a school in Rivona after parents of other students discovered their condition and demanded they not be allowed to study in the school. The students also had to change schools twice due to the objection raised by parents of other children.When a Delhi-based NGO petitioned the Supreme Court, and the apex court ruled in March this year that states include HIV-infected children in the disadvantaged group under RTE, the Goa government was forced to act on those lines. While the court had appreciated 11 states and union territories for already including HIV-infected children as a disadvantaged group, it turned out Goa was among the states that had not protected these children under the RTE Act, even though Goa notified its RTE rules seven years ago, in 2010.The state finally issued the notification in September this year.The extension of protected status to children in Goa living with or infected with HIV means that they are now entitled to special protection and measures under the terms of the RTE Act. These include eradication of discrimination, harassment, and victimisation. It will eliminate discrimination in relation to the admissions process including denying or limiting access to any benefits of enrolment or through segregation in separate study, sports, playground or canteen areas or in any other amenities provided by the school.The disadvantaged section will also get protection from financial extortion or forced expenditure and will be entitled to reservation of seats in private institutes."
HIV infection: Girl’s mother seeks central-govt probe,2017-09-22,Kochi,"News,City News,Kochi News","Kochi: Mother of a minor girl with leukaemia who was infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) allegedly after undergoing blood transfusion at Regional Cancer Centre ( RCC ), Thiruvananthapuram, has approached the Kerala high court seeking a probe by the central government.In a petition filed before the high court on Friday, the girl’s mother sought an order directing a probe by the secretary of ministry of health and family welfare as well as by the chief secretary of the state government.The petitioner alleged that the state government failed to take any action even after orders were issued by the state human rights commission and the child rights commission.In the petition, the mother points out that all bodily tests, including the one for HIV, were carried out at the time of admission to RCC on September 28 and the result was negative. After the blood transfusion from the blood bank of RCC, the girl was affected by HIV virus. This was confirmed by further tests done at RCC and various hospitals, the petition stated.“The patient admitted for cancer treatment became an HIV patient. The irresponsibility and culpable negligence of the hospital and authorities are in violation to the natural right and right to live, which was guaranteed under the Constitution of India. The state human rights commission and child rights commissions had suo motu intervened in the matter and directed for urgent actions. But nothing was done by the state government other than forming some inquiry committees as usual,” the petition said.The petitioner, along with seeking a court order for a probe by central government, has also demanded compensation, rehabilitation, and treatment for the victim. A probe must be conducted by the central government and the chief secretary of the state government against the erring officials and also whether similar incidents occurred during blood transfusion before at RCC and other hospitals. As an interim measure, the government must be directed to grant adequate financial aid to the victim, the petitioner has demanded.Reports by high-level team appointed by the state government, the Kerala AIDS Control Society and an internal probe held by the cancer centre had stated that RCC was not at fault.The report by the high-level team said there was no technical error on the part of the RCC. As per the report, the virus might have been transmitted through the blood which was transfused during the window period. A person who has freshly contracted HIV may take four to 12 weeks for the virus to be detected."
22 migrant workers from state test positive for HIV,2017-10-13,Jaipur,"News,City News,Jaipur News","Jaipur: It came as a shocker for 34-year-old Mukesh (name changed), who had come back home to Sirohi after seven months to celebrate Diwali with his family, when he tested positive for HIV/ AIDS at a camp specially organised by the health department for migrant population.Not only Mukesh, 21 others (a total of 22 so far) have already been tested positive for HIV in four days after the camp began. For them, the festivities are not only over, but the future has never looked bleaker.“These are people who are returning home to celebrate after a long time. They are categorised as migratory population, who are always at a high risk of being infected by HIV,” said Pradeep Chaudhary, additional project director, Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS).“We organise camps and provide HIV testing facilities free of cost to migratory population. It is completely voluntary and we do not force anyone to undergo testing,” he said.The health camps began on October 9 and will continue till October 18. “When people return home after a long time to celebrate Diwali, the health department helps them to get the test done. If they test positive, they may spread the virus to their spouses,” officials said.The department is expecting more such cases to be reported in the remaining six days of the special drive.The RSACS has identified 10 districts in the state with the highest number of migratory population to hold these camps. These are Banswara, Jodhpur, Bhilwara, Pali, Chittorgarh, Rajsamand, Dungarpur, Sirohi, Jalore and Udaipur.A large number of people from the state work as labourers and in other professions in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, among others. Many of them stay in these states without their families for months.According to RSACS, the prevalence of HIV in the state is about 0.32% of the total population. By organising health camps for 10 days ahead of different festivals, the health department aims to prevent the spread of HIV in the state.According to officials, if a person is unaware that he is HIV positive, there are chances of him spreading the virus to other healthy persons unintentionally."

Hospitals offering endoscopy follow protocol,2017-09-27,KOCHI,"News,City News,Kochi News,Civic Issues","KOCHI: Majority of hospitals in the state offering endoscopy procedure, a nonsurgical procedure used to examine a person's digestive tract, follow the essential disinfection protocols.This is important in the wake of recent controversy where parent of a nine-yearold leukaemia patient tested positive for HIV alleged that his child got HIV after undergoing a blood transfusion at Regional Cancer Centre.A paper, “Cleansing and disinfection of endoscopic instruments: Are we doing enough to protect our patients from infection?“ was recently presented at the Indian Society of Gastroenterology Kerala chapter) midterm conference. To know if the disinfection protocols were being followed, 35 centres performing endoscopy was studied and it was found that 97 % followed the essential disinfection protocols.Failure to properly disinfect endoscopic instruments increases the risk of transmitting Hepatitis B or C, HIV , TB and H. pylori. Gastroenterologists admit that about 5 % of patients who undergo procedures like colonoscopy and endoscopy are at risk of transmitting infection due to the failure of hospital authorities to ensure proper disinfection of the instruments.“Hospital-acquired infections are a worldwide problem and though not intentional, a patient who goes to a hospital is vulnerable to infection. Endoscopic instruments are passed inside the gastro-intestinal tract of the patients and have to be re used on several patients in a day. Therefore, systematic disinfection process is important,“ said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, senior consultant gastroenterologist, Sunrise Hospital, Kochi, who conducted the study. He said that endoscopy related infections are extremely rare, in fact they occur one in about 10 lakh procedures.Cleaning and disinfection of instruments using standard equipment and chemicals is needed to prevent germs from being passed on from patient to patient. “Majority follows the established protocols and also regularly attend authorised training sessions that keeps them updated. Among those contacted, 100 % of the technicians regularly attended training sessions and 97 % followed all the essential dis infection protocols,“ said Dr Jayadevan.To bring down such cases, the ISG has been regularly conducting courses for endoscopy technicians.“With regular training and awareness, almost all centres are now maintaining hygiene and cleanliness,“ said Dr Benoy Sebastian, Secretary, Indian Society of Gastroenterology, Kerala chapter.However, they don't rule out human error. “The large number of procedures, patients and staff increases the chance for such errors. Training of staff and audit are important steps in maintaining flawless standards. It is important therefore to ensure that endoscopy technician be consistent in their placement and training,“ added Dr Jayadevan."

We, the Leaders of the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Russian Federation, the Republic of India, the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa, met on 4 September 2017 in Xiamen, China, at the Ninth BRICS Summit. Under the theme “BRICS: Stronger Partnership for a Brighter Future”, we endeavor to build on our achievements already made with a shared vision for future development of BRICS. We also discussed international and regional issues of common concern and adopted the Xiamen Declaration by consensus.2. We reiterate that it is the overarching objective and our desire for peace, security, development and cooperation that brought us together 10 years ago. BRICS countries have since traversed a remarkable journey together on their respective development paths tailored to their national circumstances, devoted to growing their economies and improving people’s livelihoods. Our committed and concerted efforts have generated a momentum of all-dimensional and multi-layered cooperation fostered by the previous Leaders’ Summits. Upholding development and multilateralism, we are working together for a more just, equitable, fair, democratic and representative international political and economic order.4. Our cooperation since 2006 has fostered the BRICS spirit featuring mutual respect and understanding, equality, solidarity, openness, inclusiveness and mutually beneficial cooperation, which is our valuable asset and an inexhaustible source of strength for BRICS cooperation.

We note that against the backdrop of more solid global economic growth, enhanced resilience and emerging new drivers, BRICS countries continue to play an important role as engines of global growth. Noting the uncertainties and downside risks that persist, we emphasize the need to be vigilant in guarding against inward-looking policies and tendencies that are weighing on global growth prospects and market confidence. We call upon all countries to calibrate and communicate their macroeconomic and structural policies and strengthen policy coordination.8. We note that practical economic cooperation has traditionally served as a foundation of BRICS cooperation, notably through implementing the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership and initiatives related to its priority areas such as trade and investment, manufacturing and minerals processing, infrastructure connectivity, financial integration, science, technology and innovation, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) cooperation, among others.

We reaffirm our commitment to fully implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We will also advocate equitable, open, all-round, innovation-driven and inclusive development, to achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental- in a balanced and integrated manner. We support the important role of the United Nations, including the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), in coordinating and reviewing global implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and support the need to reform the UN Development System with a view to enhancing its capability in supporting Member States in implementing the 2030 Agenda. We urge developed countries to honor their Official Development Assistance commitments in time and in full and provide more development resources to developing countries.15.

Stressing the importance of environmental cooperation to sustainable development of our countries and the well-being of our peoples, we agree to take concrete actions to advance result-oriented cooperation in such areas as prevention of air and water pollution, waste management and biodiversity conservation. We recognize the importance of an environmentally sound technology platform and of improving urban environmental sustainability, and support BRICS joint efforts in this regard. Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa appreciate and support China's hosting of the meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2020.18. Noting the fruitful agricultural cooperation over the past years, we recognize the unique characteristics and complementarity of BRICS countries in agricultural development and vast cooperation potential in this area. In this connection, we agree to deepen cooperation in the five priority areas such as food security and nutrition, adaptation of agriculture to climate change, agricultural technology cooperation and innovation, agricultural trade and investment, and ICT application in agriculture to contribute to stable global agricultural growth and achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. We welcome the establishment in India of the Coordination Center of BRICS Agriculture Research Platform, a virtual network which will facilitate addressing these priority areas.19.

We acknowledge that corruption including illicit money and financial flows, and ill-gotten wealth stashed in foreign jurisdictions is a global challenge which may impact negatively on economic growth and sustainable development. We will strive to coordinate our approach in this regard and encourage a stronger global commitment to prevent and combat corruption on the basis of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and other relevant international legal instruments.21. Living in the era of digital economy, we are ready to use opportunities it provides and address challenges it poses for the global growth. We will act on the basis of principles of innovation, partnership, synergy, flexibility, open and favorable business environment, trust and security, protection of consumer rights in order to ensure the conditions for a thriving and dynamic digital economy, that will foster global economic development and benefit everyone.22.

Recalling the Saint-Petersburg and Udaipur Declarations of BRICS Ministers for Disaster Management and the decision to establish a BRICS Joint Taskforce on Disaster Risk Management, we underline the importance of consistent joint work of emergency services of BRICS countries aimed at building a safer future by reducing existing disaster risks, including exchange of information on best practices concerning disaster risk management and cooperation in the field of forecasting and early warning for effective response to natural and human induced disasters.28. We note with satisfaction the progress in BRICS cooperation in such fields as audit, statistics and export credit and agree to further advance cooperation in these fields.29. We resolve to foster a global economic governance architecture that is more effective and reflective of current global economic landscape, increasing the voice and representation of emerging markets and developing economies. We reaffirm our commitment to conclude the IMF’s 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula, by the 2019 Spring Meetings and no later than the 2019 Annual Meetings. We will continue to promote the implementation of the World Bank Group Shareholding Review.30. We emphasize the importance of an open and resilient financial system to sustainable growth and development, and agree to better leverage the benefits of capital flows and manage the risks stemming from excessive cross-border capital flows and fluctuation. The BRICS CRA represents a milestone of BRICS financial cooperation and development, which also contributes to global financial stability. We welcome the establishment of the CRA System of Exchange in Macroeconomic Information (SEMI), and the agreement to further strengthen the research capability of the CRA, and to promote closer cooperation between the IMF and the CRA.31. We welcome the establishment of the NDB Africa Regional Center launched in South Africa, which is the first regional office of the Bank. We welcome the setting up of the Project Preparation Fund and the approval of the 2nd batch of projects. We congratulate the Bank on the ground-breaking of its permanent headquarters building. We stress the significance of infrastructure connectivity to foster closer economic ties and partnerships among countries. We encourage the NDB to fully leverage its role and enhance cooperation with multilateral development institutions including the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as well as with the BRICS Business Council, to forge synergy in mobilizing resources and promote infrastructure construction and sustainable development of BRICS countries.32. We emphasize the importance of an open and inclusive world economy enabling all countries and peoples to share in the benefits of globalization. We remain firmly committed to a rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive multilateral trading system as embodied in the WTO. We reaffirm our commitments to ensure full implementation and enforcement of existing WTO rules and are determined to work together to further strengthen the WTO. We call for the acceleration of the implementation of the Bali and Nairobi MCM outcomes and for the WTO ministerial conference to be held this year in Argentina to produce positive outcomes. We will continue to firmly oppose protectionism. We recommit to our existing pledge for both standstill and rollback of protectionist measures and we call upon other countries to join us in that commitment.33. Valuing the G20’s continued role as the premier forum for international economic cooperation, we reiterate our commitments to the implementation of the outcomes of G20 summits, including the Hamburg Summit and the Hangzhou Summit. We call upon the G20 to further enhance macroeconomic policy coordination to minimize negative spillovers and external shocks to EMDEs. We agree to enhance coordination and cooperation under the Argentina Presidency in 2018, with an aim to make the G20 process and outcomes reflect the interests and priorities of EMDEs.34. We reaffirm our commitment to achieving a fair and modern global tax system and promoting a more equitable, pro-growth and efficient international tax environment, including to deepening cooperation on addressing Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), promoting exchange of tax information and improving capacity-building in developing countries. We will strengthen BRICS tax cooperation to increase BRICS contribution to setting international tax rules and provide, according to each country’s priorities, effective and sustainable technical assistance to other developing countries.35. Cognizant of the profound changes the world is undergoing and the global security challenges and threats faced by the international community, we commit to enhance communication and cooperation in international fora on issues concerning international peace and security. We reiterate our commitment to safeguarding world peace and security and to upholding the basic norms of the international law, and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations including sovereign equality and non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs.36. We welcome the 7th Meeting of the BRICS High Representatives for Security Issues held on 27-28 July 2017 in Beijing, and commend the meeting for having discussion and deepening our common understanding on global governance, counter-terrorism, security in the use of ICTs, energy security, major international and regional hotspots as well as national security and development. We note Brazil’s proposal to establish a BRICS Intelligence Forum. We welcome Chair’s report to us on the proceedings of the Meeting and encourage the succeeding chairpersonships to continue this exercise. We look forward to enhancing practical security cooperation agreed upon in the above areas37. We welcome China’s hosting of the Meeting of BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs/International Relations in Beijing on 18-19 June 2017 at the initiative of China. Ministers exchanged views on major global political, security, economic and financial issues of common concern and on strengthening BRICS cooperation. We look forward to the upcoming meeting of Foreign Ministers on the margins of the UNGA. We welcome South Africa’s offer to host the next stand-alone Foreign Ministers Meeting in 2018.38. We recall that development and security are closely interlinked, mutually reinforcing and key to attaining sustainable peace. We reiterate our view that the establishment of sustainable peace requires a comprehensive, concerted and determined approach, based on mutual trust, mutual benefit, equity and cooperation, that addresses the causes of conflicts, including their political, economic and social dimensions. We condemn unilateral military interventions, economic sanctions and arbitrary use of unilateral coercive measures in violation of international law and universally recognized norms of international relations. We emphasize that no country should enhance its security at the expense of the security of others.39. We reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations as the universal multilateral organization entrusted with the mandate for maintaining international peace and security, advance global development and to promote and protect human rights.40. We recall the 2005 World Summit Outcome document and reaffirm the need for a comprehensive reform of the UN, including its Security Council, with a view to making it more representative, effective and efficient, and to increase the representation of the developing countries so that it can adequately respond to global challenges. China and Russia reiterate the importance they attach to the status and role of Brazil, India and South Africa in international affairs and support their aspiration to play a greater role in the UN.41. We reiterate that the only lasting solution to the crisis in Syria is through an inclusive “Syrian-led, Syrian-owned” political process which safeguards the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria, in pursuance of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254(2015), and promotes the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people. We strongly support the Geneva Peace Talks and the Astana process, and welcome the creation of the de-escalation areas in Syria, which contributed to decrease the levels of violence and generate positive momentum and conditions for meaningful progress in the peace talks under the auspices of the UN. We oppose the use of chemical weapons by anyone, for any purpose and under any circumstance.42. We reiterate the urgent need for a just, lasting and comprehensive solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in order to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions, the Madrid Principles, the Arab Peace Initiative and previous agreements between the parties through negotiations with a view to creating an independent, viable, territorially contiguous Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel. Committed to making greater contribution to such solution, we express readiness to enhance our contribution towards a just and lasting resolution of the Middle East conflict and support international efforts to promote peace and stability in the region.43. We congratulate the people and Government of Iraq for the recovery of Mosul and for the progress achieved in the fight against terrorism and reaffirm our commitment to Iraq’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence and our support for Iraqi government and its people. We express our concern over the situation in Yemen and urge all parties to cease hostilities and to resume negotiations supported by the United Nations. We also call on all parties directly involved in the current diplomatic crisis in the Gulf region to overcome their dissensions through dialogue and welcome the efforts of Kuwaiti mediation in this regard.44. We strongly deplore the nuclear test conducted by the DPRK. We express deep concern over the ongoing tension and prolonged nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, and emphasize that it should only be settled through peaceful means and direct dialogue of all the parties concerned.45. We firmly support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on the Iranian nuclear issue and call upon all relevant parties to comply fully with their obligations and ensure full and effective implementation of the JCPOA to promote international and regional peace and stability.46. We commend the efforts of African countries, the African Union and sub-regional organizations in addressing regional issues and maintaining regional peace and security, and emphasize the importance of collaboration between the United Nations and the African Union in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. We support efforts towards comprehensively resolving the issues in Democratic Republic of Congo, Libya, South Sudan, Somalia, Central Africa Republic and Western Sahara.47. We strongly condemn terrorist attacks resulting in death to innocent Afghan nationals. There is a need for immediate cessation of violence. We reaffirm our support to the people of Afghanistan in their efforts to achieve “Afghan-led and Afghan-owned” peace and national reconciliation, to the ongoing international efforts, including the Moscow Format of consultations on Afghanistan and “Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process”, as well as multimodal connectivity projects to promote peace and stability, to the fight against terrorism and drug-threat, and to the national reconstruction efforts by Afghanistan. We support the efforts of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces in fighting terrorist organizations.48. We, in this regard, express concern on the security situation in the region and violence caused by the Taliban, ISIL/DAISH, Al-Qaida and its affiliates including Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the Haqqani network, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, TTP and Hizb ut-Tahrir.49. We deplore all terrorist attacks worldwide, including attacks in BRICS countries, and condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations wherever committed and by whomsoever and stress that there can be no justification whatsoever for any act of terrorism. We reaffirm that those responsible for committing, organizing, or supporting terrorist acts must be held accountable. Recalling the primary leading role and responsibility of states in preventing and countering terrorism, we stress the necessity to develop international cooperation, in accordance with the principles of international law, including that of sovereign equality of states and non-interference in their internal affairs. We reaffirm solidarity and resolve in the fight against terrorism, value the 2nd BRICS Counter-Terrorism Working Group Meeting held in Beijing on 18 May 2017, and agree to strengthen our cooperation.50. We call upon all nations to adopt a comprehensive approach in combating terrorism, which should include countering radicalization, recruitment, movement of terrorists including Foreign Terrorist Fighters, blocking sources of financing terrorism including, for instance, through organized crime by means of money-laundering, supply of weapons, drug trafficking and other criminal activities, dismantling terrorist bases, and countering misuse of the Internet including social media by terrorist entities through misuse of the latest Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). We are committed to prevent and counter the growing spread of terrorist narratives, and to tackle all sources, techniques and channels of terrorist financing. We call for swift and effective implementation of relevant UNSC Resolutions and the FATF International Standards worldwide. We seek to intensify our cooperation in FATF and FATF-style regional bodies (FSRBs). We recall the responsibility of all States to prevent financing of terrorist networks and terrorist actions from their territories.51. We call upon the international community to establish a genuinely broad international counter-terrorism coalition and support the UN’s central coordinating role in this regard. We stress that the fight against terrorism must be conducted in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, international refugee and humanitarian law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. We reaffirm our commitment on increasing the effectiveness of the UN counter-terrorism framework, including in the areas of cooperation and coordination among the relevant UN entities, designation of terrorists and terrorist groups and technical assistance to Members States. We call for expeditious finalization and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) by the United Nations General Assembly.52. We recognize the important contribution of BRICS countries to United Nations peacekeeping operations, and the importance of United Nations peacekeeping operations to international peace and security. We emphasize the need for BRICS countries to further enhance communication on peacekeeping matters.53. We reiterate our commitment to address the world drug problem based on the United Nations drug control conventions, through an integrated, comprehensive and balanced approach to drug supply and demand reduction strategies. We stress the importance of the outcome document of the 30th Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly on the world drug problem, and call for strengthening of international and regional cooperation and coordination to counter the global threat caused by the illicit production and trafficking of drugs, especially opiates. We note with deep concern the increasing links in some regions of the world between drug trafficking, money laundering and organized crime and terrorism.54. We reiterate the need for all countries to cooperate in promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms under the principles of equality and mutual respect. We agree to continue to treat all human rights, including the right to development, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis. We will strengthen cooperation on issues of common interests both within BRICS and in multilateral fora including the United Nations Human Rights Council, taking into account the necessity to promote, protect and fulfill human rights in a non-selective, non-politicized and constructive manner, and without double standards.55. Keenly aware of the global security challenges faced by the international community in the area of international migration, we emphasize the growing role of effective migration regulation for the benefit of international security and development of the society.56. We consider the UN has a central role in developing universally accepted norms of responsible state behavior in the use of ICTs to ensure a peaceful, secure, open, cooperative, stable, orderly, accessible and equitable ICT environment. We emphasize the paramount importance of the principles of international law enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, particularly the state sovereignty, the political independence, territorial integrity and sovereign equality of states, non-interference in internal affairs of other states and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We emphasize the need to enhance international cooperation against terrorist and criminal misuse of ICTs, reaffirm the general approach laid in the eThekwini, Fortaleza, Ufa and Goa declarations in this regard, and recognize the need for a universal regulatory binding instrument on combatting the criminal use of ICTs under the UN auspices as stated in the Ufa Declaration. We note with satisfaction the progress achieved by the Working Group of Experts of the BRICS States on Security in the use of ICTs. We decide to promote cooperation according to the BRICS Roadmap of Practical Cooperation on Ensuring Security in the Use of ICTs or any other mutually agreed mechanism and acknowledge the initiative of the Russian Federation on a BRICS intergovernmental agreement on cooperation in ensuring security in the use of ICTs.57. We believe that all states should participate on an equal footing in the evolution and functioning of the Internet and its governance, bearing in mind the need to involve relevant stakeholders in their respective roles and responsibilities. The structures that manage and regulate the critical Internet resources need to be made more representative and inclusive. We note with satisfaction the progress made by the BRICS Working Group on ICT Cooperation. We recognize the necessity to strengthen our cooperation in this area. To that end, BRICS will continue to work together through the existing mechanism to contribute to the secure, open, peaceful and cooperative use of ICTs on the basis of equal participation of the international community in its management.58. We reiterate that outer space shall be free for peaceful exploration and used by all States on the basis of equality in accordance with international law. Reaffirming that outer space shall remain free from any kind of weapons or any use of force, we stress that negotiations for the conclusion of an international agreement or agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space are a priority task of the United Nations Conference on Disarmament, and support the efforts to start substantive work, inter alia, based on the updated draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of force against outer space objects submitted by China and the Russian Federation. We also note an international initiative for a political obligation on the no first placement of weapons in outer space.59. Priority should be accorded to ensuring the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, as well as ways and means of preserving outer space for future generations. We note that this is an important objective on the current agenda of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS). In this respect, we welcome the decision by the UNCOPUOS Scientific and Technical Sub-Committee Working Group on Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities to conclude negotiations and achieve consensus on the full set of guidelines for the long term sustainability of outer space activities by 2018 to coincide with the commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the first United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE + 50).60. We emphasize the importance of people-to-people exchanges to promoting development and enhancing mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation among BRICS peoples. We agree to deepen cooperation in such fields as culture, education, science and technology, sports and health as well as among media organizations and local governments, to strengthen the third pillar of BRICS cooperation and foster a meaningful resonance of the BRICS partnership amongst its peoples.61. We value cultural diversity as a precious asset of BRICS cooperation. We stress the role of culture and cultural diversity in promoting sustainable development, and encourage BRICS countries to engage in cultural exchanges and mutual learning to cultivate common values on the basis of diversity and sharing. We welcome the formulation of a BRICS action plan to advance practical cultural cooperation and the establishment of the BRICS Alliance of Libraries, Alliance of Museums, Alliance of Art Museums and National Galleries as well as Alliance of Theaters for Children and Young People. We look forward to the success of the BRICS Culture Festival to be held later in mid-September 2017 in Xiamen. We will continue our work on the establishment of a BRICS Cultural Council to provide the necessary platform to enhance cultural cooperation among BRICS countries.62. We stress the importance of education to promoting sustainable economic and social development, and to strengthening BRICS partnership, and commend the positive progress in our education cooperation. We reiterate our support for BRICS University League and BRICS Network University in conducting education and research cooperation, welcome efforts to promote cooperation among educational think tanks, and exchanges among youth including by organizing youth summer camps and offering more scholarship opportunities to BRICS students. We agree to share experience and practices in realizing education-related sustainable development goals.63. We believe in the importance of sports cooperation to popularizing traditional sports and deepening the friendship among BRICS peoples. Recalling the successful hosting of BRICS U-17 Football Tournament in Goa in 2016, we commend the success of the First BRICS Games, which was a highlight of this year’s people-to-people exchanges. We encourage relevant departments to sign an MOU on sports cooperation to provide greater impetus to sports cooperation among our five countries.64. We agree to enhance BRICS role in global health governance, especially in the context of the World Health Organization and UN agencies, and foster the development and improve the availability of innovative medical products through promotion of research and development and access to affordable, quality, effective and safe drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and other medical products and technologies as well as to medical services through enhanced health systems and health financing. We agree to improve surveillance capacity and medical services to combat infectious diseases, including Ebola, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as non-communicable diseases and encourage greater application of ICTs to improve the level of health service provision. We welcome the outcomes of the BRICS Health Ministers Meeting and High-level Meeting on Traditional Medicine, and commend the establishment of a long-term mechanism for traditional medicine exchanges and cooperation, to promote mutual learning of traditional medicines and pass them down to future generations. We welcome the decision to set up the Tuberculosis Research Network, to be presented at the First WHO Global Ministerial Conference Ending Tuberculosis in the Sustainable Development Era: A Multisectoral Response, Moscow, Russian Federation, 16-17 November 2017. We express support for the meeting as well as the First United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting on Tuberculosis in 2018. We commit ourselves to enhanced cooperation at international fora on health matters including at G20.65. We reaffirm our commitment to promote a long-term and balanced demographic development and continue cooperation on population related matters in accordance with the Agenda for BRICS Cooperation on Population Matters for 2015-2020.66. We note with satisfaction the progress in the exchanges and cooperation in various areas, including governance, film-making, media, think-tank, youth, parliament, local governments and trade union, and agree to further advance such exchanges and cooperation. We commend the first joint film production by BRICS countries and commend the success of the BRICS Film Festival, the Media Forum, Friendship Cities and Local Governments Cooperation Forum, Youth Forum, Young Diplomats Forum and Young Scientists Forum. We appreciate the successful hosting of the BRICS Forum of Political Parties, Think-Tanks and Civil Society Organizations as well as the Seminar on Governance, and will carry these good initiatives forward in the future. In this regard, we note the proposal to establish by China the BRICS Research and Exchange Fund.67. We appreciate the important progress in BRICS institutional development and reiterate our commitment to further strengthen it to make BRICS cooperation more responsive to the changing situation. We commend China for taking measures during its Chairmanship to enhance the Sherpas’ coordination role in BRICS cooperation. We instruct the Sherpas to continue their discussion concerning BRICS institutional development.68. We recommit our strong support for multilateralism and the central role of the UN in international affairs. We commit to strengthening the coordination and cooperation among BRICS in the areas of mutual and common interests within the UN and other multilateral institutions, including through regular meetings among our permanent representatives in New York, Geneva and Vienna, and further enhance the voice of BRICS in international fora.69. In continuation of BRICS tradition of outreach since the Durban Summit, we will hold a Dialogue of Emerging Market and Developing Countries on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the building of broad partnerships for development under the theme of “Strengthening Mutually-Beneficial Cooperation for Common Development” in promotion of BRICS Plus cooperation.70.

"yemen: From malnutrition in India to treating injured in Yemen, this Vijayawada doctor has seen it all",2017-09-04,VIJAYAWADA,"News,City News,Vijayawada News","VIJAYAWADA: Dr Shiny Kaki (30) from Vijayawada is not your average general physician that cures with cough or cold patients but rather witnessed an outbreak of diseases and treated the war wounded in conflict zones in countries like Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen Right after completing her MBBS education at CMC College in Vellore at 2009, Dr Shiny did her two years of rural service in leprosy hospital in Allahabad. She managed to cure many patients.""There is a misconception that leprosy is incurable. It is completely curable where the first dose of anti-bacteria would kill 90% of the bacteria but the stigma keeps them from coming to the hospital and even acknowledging that it's a disease,"" Shiny Kaki said.Later, she did a research at Welcome Trust Research Lab in Vellore where the project was funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health in America. She was the project manager in India and served the malnourished which was only prevalent in marginalized communities like Narikurava tribes. During her research, Dr Shiny understood that they don't exclusively breast fed which is recommended by WHO. Almost two years later in September 2013 to February 2014, she joined Médecins Sans Frontières aka Doctors without Borders which changed her life completely.In her first project she was taken to Warder situated at the border between Ethiopia and Somalia, a conflict zone between the two countries.Explaining the tense environment, Shiny said, ""weapons are not allowed in the hospital, but we see Al Shabab militia and even little children holding guns behave in a very mature manner. But luckily they are aware that we are apolitical and are there to only save lives so they wouldn't do anything to us."" She worked in the emergency room, HIV and TB ward and paediatric ward and witnessed the war between Ethiopian army, Somilian police and where residents get affected in the crossfire.""Overcrowding in refugee camps has been the predominant reason for outbreak of diseases like TB and other diseases. They don't get proper nutrition,"" Dr Shiny said.Later she went to a refugee camp in South Sudan where basic medical service like maternity was lacking.After six months, she served in Maiduguri in Nigeria where a malnutrition emergency exists. Boko Haram's terrorism played a big role in the region where she witnessed a bomb blast at the market place."

When eye bank officials reached 45-year-old person to retrieve his cornea after his death in Vallabh Nagar in Kota, the team had to return empty handed.“Not everyone can donate eyes. If a person dies of dengue, we cannot retrieve his eyes. Such an incident happened in Vallabh Nagar on Saturday,“ said Dr Kulwant Gaur, founder president of an NGO promoting eye donation.He said that in August and September such cases frequently been reported. In these months, vector borne disease such as dengue and now swine flu has also becomes a menace. In such a situation, eye donation has affected. “It has happened at least five times in past 30 days, when our team came back empty handed,“ Dr Gaur said.In the state, this year so far, 107 persons have died of swine flu but they are not eligible for donating cornea.According to the health department officials, there are 1.2lakh people need corneal transplant for regaining vision. In such a situation each cornea becomes valuable as it can bring back vision of corneal blind people. Every year around 20,000 new patients added to the existing patients needing corneal transplant.Health department's official figures show that 498 corneas have already been donated in the state in 2017-18. Doctors have transplanted them into 296 corneal blind people in the state. A health department official said, “Patient who died with HIV swine flu and dengue virus are not eligible for donating cornea.“Official figures show that 1,414 corneas were collected in 2015-16 and 778 were transplanted, while in 2016-17, a total of 944 were transplant. Health department officials said discarded corneas were not fit for transplant as there endothelial cell density was less than 21,000 per one cubic mm. While retrieving eyes, they collect blood sample of the donor. The cornea were also rejected as from the blood testing there were found infected with HIV, Hepatitis B, dengue or any other viral disease which could be transmitted to the recipient during eye transplant Meanwhile, health minister Kalicharan Saraf flagged off a rally in the city for creating awareness on eye donation on Thursday. Saraf said that nationally , 50% of cornea collected are transplanted but here in Rajasthan, the percentage is 62%."
"15,000 health activists hit the streets hoping for better salary",2017-09-08,BENGALURU,"News,City News,Bengaluru News","BENGALURU: Freedom Park turned into a sea of pink on Thursday as thousands of Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha) gathered to voice their concerns and place their demands before the authorities. Braving the rain, over 15,000 women protested, demanding a fixed monthly salary of Rs 6,000 for their services toward the state’s pregnant women. They also sought Freedom Park along with PF and insurance benefits , among others.The women, some of whom got their kids along, are on a night-long dharna. Alleging lack of proper data entry in recording the work they do, they urged the government to do away with Asha Soft, a software meant for this very purpose.Addressing the protesters, principal secretary, health and family welfare department, Shalini Rajneesh said: ""I feel sad that all of you came from various districts to demand your rights. You are those who listen to others’ woes. Currently, we are moving to a new system. The government has decided to pay Rs 5,000 from September 1 and a government order has been issued. Regarding problems with data entry, the government will appoint one operator in each taluk to feed work-related details of Ashas,"" she said.The women, however, stuck to their demand — a fixed monthly salary of Rs 6,000 — and said they won’t budge till health and family welfare minister R Ramesh Kumar announces their demands have been fulfilled.Some protesters who had come with their children were accommodated in 15 nearby choultries on Thursday night.D Nagalakshmi, secretary, Karnataka state Asha Workers’ Association, who spearheaded the protest, said the government must consider the hard work put in by these women. ""Most of these health workers have been working without incentives for months.States like Telangana and Kerala are giving Rs 6,000 to Ashas recruited under the National Health Mission ,"" said Nagalakshmi.They take care of women through their pregnancy and also accompany them for check-ups and scans. But if a woman decides to deliver at a private hospital or gives birth at home, these workers don’t get a single paise.Each worker is a foot soldier for the public health system, taking care of 250 families or a population of 1,000-1,500. Indira I B Hallad, a worker from Hunagunda, Bagalkot, said she hasn’t got evenRs 1,000 as incentive for the last three months. ""We depend on this job and hope to get a salary. From meeting pregnant women and going for surveys to finding cases of TB, spotting mosquito-breeding points and making sure children are immunized — we care for others. But who cares for us,"" she asked.Bharathi from Gangavathi district, north Karnataka, had no option but to get her one-year-old son along. ""Where do I leave him if I have to join the protest? We care for others, but nobody cares for us,"" she said, voicing thex concerns of many.Why is the government recruiting only women as Associated Social Health Activists (ASHA) workers? It’s because the government thinks women don’t question. How do you expect them to work without salary?Meeting with ministerAt 8.30pm, health minster Ramesh Kumar met the protesters and sought to convince them to withdraw the protest, but in vain. Rama, an ASHA workers' representative, said: ""He assured us that our demands would be met after discussions with other bureaucrats and officials.""* They monitor health of pregnant women, newborns, TB, HIV patients, take part in routine immunization drives, Pulse Polio drives* In July, only 43 ASHAs got incentives of more than Rs 10,000. Incentives depend on medical officers in government hospitals acknowledging their work and making proper data entryWe keep track of the person’s due date and convince the family to take her to a hospital and also accompany her. After childbirth, we make sure the child is immunized and attend to the new mother. For this, we get paid Rs 300 if the patient if from a BPL family, and Rs 200 if she is from an APL family. However, the amount reaches us only if the hospital does the data entry."
Centre to roll out action plan by October to curb hepatitis,2017-09-12,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: Setting itself a three-year target to eliminate hepatitis , which affects 52 million people in the country, the health ministry is gearing up to roll out a national action plan by October end.“The plan is in its final stages and we will be launching it very soon. The three main components of the plan are testing, treatment and drugs. We will focus on making these three available across the country and increase awareness about good sanitation and safe water,” a senior official in the health ministry told TOI.Prevalence of hepatitis B is high in tribal areas in India. Chronic Hepatitis B infection accounts for about 30% of liver cirrhosis and 40-50% of liver cancers in India. Outbreaks of acute and fulminant hepatitis B still occur mainly due to inadequately sterilised needles and syringes.Experts say over 90% of Hepatitis C patients can be cured with treatment. However, most people infected with the disease are unaware of it. Apart from making testing and treatment options available at district levels, the action plan will also include testing guidelines and training for healthcare workers. The government will also identify high burden districts under the action plan and put them under greater surveillance.“The regional action plan for Hepatitis B and C will focus on five essential components – expanding coverage for Hepatitis B vaccine, blood safety, making treatment options available, prevention from reusable syringes and sanitation and safe water,” an expert with the World Health Organisation (WHO) said. The health ministry is working with the UN agency to develop the action plan.Viral hepatitis has been recognised as a serious public health problem in India by WHO. India contributes over 15% of the entire pool of hepatitis B in the world. Every year, nearly 6,00,000 patients die from HBV (hepatitis B virus) infection in the Indian subcontinent. Globally, over 400 million people are infected with hepatitis B and C, more than 10 times the number of people living with HIV."
Poultry waste too raising antibiotics resistance,2017-09-02,NEW DELHI,"News,India News","NEW DELHI: Rampant misuse of antibiotics in poultry farms is leading to large-scale antibiotic resistance because of unsafe disposal of poultry litter and waste in agricultural land, says a new study by the Centre for Science and Environment.The study -`Antibiotic Resistance in Poultry Environment' -found that misuse of antibiotics in animals is leading to proliferation of multidrug resistant bacteria, which has a potential to infect human beings.Anti-microbial resistance threatens effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infectious diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, urinary tract infection (UTI) and even HIV. While all countries are struggling with the problem of rising drug resistance, India is primarily coping with antibiotic resistance which is posing an increasing threat to treating infectious diseases, as well as undermining many other advances in medicine.Currently, over 700,000 global deaths each year are attributed to drug resistance. In India, an additional two million lives can be lost by 2050 due to drug resistance. Findings show 100% of E coli, 92% of Klebsiellapneumoniae and 78% of Staphylococcus lentusisolated from poultry environment were multi-drug resistant. About 40% of E coli, 30% of Klebsiellapneumoniaeisolates were resistant to 10 of 13 antibiotics against which bacteria were tested for resistance."
Pregnant women: Study points out health risks to pregnant women,2017-10-11,GURGAON,"News,City News,Gurgaon News","GURGAON: Almost 13% of 1,186 pregnant women who were medically examined at various government hospitals and health centres across Gurgaon on Monday were found to be facing a high risk of miscarriage, maternal mortality and other pre and post-delivery complications.In the 13% (159 women), 19 were found to be severely anaemic, four were suffering from pregnancy-induced hypertension, nine were diabetic and the remaining 127 were suffering from other high-risk factors, which may put the life of the mother as well as the fetus/infant in danger during or after the delivery.Officials said 86 of the vulnerable women, who had turned up at various community health centres, have been referred to higher/better healthcare facilities for treatments.“All ASHA workers were instructed to ensure that all pregnant women in their areas come for the check-ups. During the daylong camp, pregnant women were tested for haemoglobin, urine albumin and blood sugar levels, malaria, VDRL, HIV, etc.,” said Dr BK Rajora , chief medical officer, Gurgaon.“Now, we will ensure that these women get proper medical attention for the rest of their pregnancy and even after the delivery. We will keep a check on their health conditions and will ensure that their deliveries take place at government hospital only, and not at home or any health centre,” Rajora added.The tests were conducted under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) to identify women with high-risk pregnancy and ensure comprehensive antenatal care free of cost during the pregnancy.Health department sources said maternal mortality was a big problem in Gurgaon, where 42 maternal deaths were reported in 2016 alone. The weak health of mothers, in turn, affected the babies and around 900 infants lost their lives within a month of their birth in 2016.Further, around 30% of the infants (below one year) visiting government hospitals are suffering from deficiencies of vitamins and minerals, like iron, iodine, zinc, vitamin-A and B etc, which suggest deficiencies of one or more micronutrients in their mothers too."
‘I’m a woman who needs help when stalked or teased’,2017-09-23,NEW DELHIelhi,,"NEW DELHIelhi: “When a man touches us inappropriately or makes advance on the street, no one helps us, not even the police. Everyone’s first instinct is to say we are at fault,” an agitated Pari told a group of empowered transgender community members from across India at a “Hijra Habba” (a community congregation) in Delhi on Friday. The 21-year-old Chandni Chowk resident said she yearned to be treated like a woman her age seeking help on being stalked or teased.Pari was speaking about the frustrations of being judged wrongly by society at the workshop on ‘Inclusion: All Citizens Equal’, organised by India HIV/AIDS Alliance as part of the 5th National Hijra Habba . The aim of the discussions was to steer changes in the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016, which, according to community members, is far from perfect as an usher of change. The Bill is being reworked by the union ministry of social justice and empowerment based on the suggestions made in a parliamentary standing committee report submitted in July.A key concern articulated at the meet, in which the participants were divided into five groups to come up with a list of demands for the government, related to the guru-chela parampara of the community. Many said it was intrinsic to their way of life and any new law had to take that into account. The other concern was about the fate of the senior transgender citizens and their just entitlements and benefits as the elderly.“Will 80-year-old hijras who have lived without identity documents need identity certification when the new law comes into effect?” asked Salma Khan, who has worked for three decades with the Mumbai-based Kinnar Maa Trust. “While we want our young transgenders to become doctors and engineers, we also want a law that secures our future with respect to the past.”Reshma Prasad, 27, a doctoral candidate from Magadh University in Bihar, talked about the urgent need to mainstream transgender persons. “I got tremendous support from my mother who is a lecturer and encouraged me to study, though I faced a lot of hostility from the society. I now voice the concerns of the community through voluntary organisation Dostana Safar. Even my thesis is on the socio-economic status of transgender persons,” said Prasad. She agreed that change was possible only if the new law looked at the future without ignoring the past."
Health experts focus on NE’s need for better hepatitis care,2017-09-11,Kolkata,"News,City News,Kolkata News","Kolkata: The northeast is emerging as a hotbed for hepatitis B and C. Compounding the grim scenario is lack of awareness, financial and manpower constraints, poor accessibility to hepatitis care and high treatment cost.A policy round table by Tata Trusts, in association with Indian Institute of Liver & Digestive Sciences and Liver Foundation West Bengal ( LFWB ), in Kolkata on Sunday saw stakeholders from the region agreeing on the need to pay immediate attention to this public health issue.“Kolkata, being the gateway to the northeast, aims to play a catalyst’s role so that the contextual need for the northeast is kept in mind while framing the national policy on hepatitis B and C. The region’s needs are different from those of other states,” LFWB secretary Abhijit Chowdhury said.While Manipur and Mizoram lead the hepatitis C count, the challenge is compounded by intravenous drug abuse and HIV infection. Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland have a high prevalence of hepatitis B.“We are looking ahead to good partnerships with local NGOs, the government and healthcare professionals in the region for prevention, hepatitis care and viral hepatitis elimination,” said H S Sreenivas, who leads the healthcare initiative of Tata Trusts.“We will form a network in the northeast for better coordination and effort in eliminating hepatitis B and C in the region,” LFWB project director Partha Sarathi Mukherjee said."
"Now, Raj dept wants HIV patients to submit Aadhaar",2017-09-11,Jaipur,"News,City News,Jaipur News","Jaipur: Those living with HIV will now have to submit their Aadhaar card numbers to Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS). The move is, however, being seen as a ‘ridiculous’ one by social activists as they see it as an infringement of privacy of people living with HIV.When a 45-year-old HIV patient reached Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at Sawai Man Singh Hospital to get medicines, the healthcare staff asked her to submit Aadhaar card’s photocopy. “They asked me if I have Aadhaar card and that I should submit its photocopy,” the patient who is taking medicine for HIV for over 10 years, said.The RSACS has sent messages to all its ART centres, which provide medicines to people with HIV/AIDS across the state, to collect Aadhaar from beneficiaries.“Other departments are also linking social benefit schemes with Aadhaar, so we have also decided to link it. But, we have not made it compulsory for getting medicines. If a person does not have Aadhaar, he/she will continue to get medicines. We will not stop providing them medicines,” said Dr S S Chauhan, director, RSACS.In the state, there are 23 ART centres that provide testing and treatment facilities to 55,000 odd people living with HIV.Officials said that Aadhaar will help in keeping a track on beneficiaries (people living with HIV), who go missing during treatment. Also, through Aadhaar, department will ensure that a particular beneficiary is not registered at different ART centres. They will generate a whole database online, which will have their Aadhaar number. If a person goes to an ART for HIV testing, the online software through Aadhaar will detect automatically if he is already registered at some other ART.Reacting on it, social activists are apprehensive that this may increase risk of revealing identity of people living with HIV/AIDS.“HIV is a severe privacy issue. But it has been seen in the past that your Aadhaar is compromised at many places. There are instances of it being stolen. The question arises that how the state government will keep such database safe,” said activist Nikhil Dey.Dey said, “Once it’s leaked, how they (those who get it) will use it. There is a stigma attached to HIV, so it is ridiculous to collect Aadhaar from those who are already marginalised. If they made it mandatory, there are chances of exclusion of those who do not have Aadhaar from getting benefits of government schemes.”Social activists termed the step as “ridiculous”. Collecting Aadhaar from all people living with HIV/AIDS is quite challenging at a time when such people living with HIV/AIDS registered at ART do not share even their original name and address to ensure their original identity is not revealed to anyone, even at ART centres."

Dutch experts to study superbugs in India,2017-09-13,LUCKNOW,News,"LUCKNOW: A team of public health experts from Netherlands would study antimicrobial resistance (AMR) – the source of superbugs and a rising health concern — in India. According to the World Health Organisation, AMR threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi.Facilitated by WHO , health experts from National Institute of Public Health and Environment, Netherlands, will study AMR in three states of India — Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh — to evaluate the extent of AMR in India.A team of health experts from Netherlands and WHO have met UP health officials to draw a plan for their work. Director, epidemic and vectorborne diseases, UP, Dr Badri Vishal said, “Human, animal and environmental sources of AMR would be identified so that they can be countered.”The King George’s Medical University has been included in the study to evaluate the human aspect of the study.Superbugs pose a higher health risk in India because of several factors. Firstly, India is the biggest consumer of antibiotics. Over 60% of the population consumes antibiotics which makes it vulnerable to the risk. Secondly, most of the 12 priority pathogens (or families of Superbugs) listed by WHO have a presence in India. Thirdly, as per US Centers for Disease Control, Superbug in India could be resistant to all known antibiotics.“AMR makes standard treatment for various diseases ineffective, allowing infections to spread to others. Drug resistance would retard and complicate fight against diseases like TB, HIV and malaria. The challenge would be extremely big in India where cost and extent of damage due to population could be very high,” said health activist Bobby Ramakant.Alarmed over the scale of damage that drug resistance can cause in India, the National Health Policy of 2017 has included AMR as a priority area of work."

The Medical College police have registered case and launched a probe after receiving a complaint from the girl’s parents in this regard. The complaint has been raised by a family hailing from Alappuzha district.According to police, the case has been registered on charges of negligence against the staff of RCC. As per the complaint, the girl was found to be infected with HIV when her blood was tested prior to a surgery related to an eye disease recently. The parents confirmed the infection after testing the blood again at the medical college hospital. It was following this, they approached the police with a complaint. They alleged that only possible way the girl might have got infected with the virus is when she underwent a blood transfusion at RCC as part of her treatment.Medical College sub-inspector D Girilal said the probe has just been launched and it was too early to say whether the allegation raised against the state-run cancer care hospital was genuine. The parents of the girl have told the police that before starting treatment under RCC in March this year, the girl was treated at a few other hospitals too.‘’But, they are sure that the girl did not have the infection before the blood transfusion here as they were constantly monitoring her condition owing to continued treatment,” the sub-inspector said.Kazhakootam Cyber City assistant commissioner A Pramod Kumar, under whose jurisdiction the RCC comes, said the matter will be discussed with forensic experts and then it will be referred to a medical board as per procedureRCC director and PRO were unavailable for comments despite repeated attempts to contact them."

The probe team has issued a notice to the hospital seeking details in this regard. A police team also visited the hospital on Friday as part of the investigation. They talked to doctors and other staff and also went through files pertaining to the treatment of the girl. They have also sought copies of related files.A Pramod Kumar, assistant commissioner of police, Kazhakootam Cyber City, said the girl had underwent as many as 39 sessions of blood transfusion. The exact number of persons who donated blood is yet to be confirmed. The hospital had used units from their blood bank as well as those donated by those close to the girl’s family.“The hospital authorities said that they have a record of all the donors and have promised to share them. Once they are identified, we would be testing their blood samples for HIV,” said the ACP, adding that it was going to be a tedious and time consuming process.There is also a chance that the girl got infected from outside the hospital. The team was probing such possibilities too, the officer said.The police have already consulted medical experts and the opinion they received was that the hospital might not be fully at fault.“According to medical experts, if the donor was a healthy person, who was very recently infected with the virus, there are chances of it going undetected in the tests,” Pramod Kumar said. Hence, the possibility of a donor’s blood, the sample for which was cleared for donation, being used for transfusion cannot be ruled out.He added that the final decision in this regard would be taken by the medical board and the expert committee constituted by the state government. The police would be handing over their report to them once they finish the investigation.On Friday, the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights registered a case suo motu in connection with the incident based on media reports. The commission has asked the RCC director and State AIDS Control Society to file reports in this regard within 15 days.Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala visited the girl and the family at the hospital on Friday. Speaking to the media after the visit, he termed the incident as a serious lapse on part of the health department. He also contacted chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan over phone and demanded a detailed probe."
Housewives of Pilibhit hosp staff seek CM intervention to get rid of bio dump,2017-09-13,Pilibhit,"News,City News,Bareilly News","Pilibhit: Upset over dumping of bio-medical waste in open on the district hospital campus, housewives of health officials living in nearby government quarters have appealed to chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath to save their children from serious infections.In a letter to the chief minister, the complainants stated that when the dumped waste accumulates in huge quantity, it is set on fire. They demanded stringent action against erring officials.According to one of the complainants, Upama Singh, hospital staff have developed hazardous practice of dumping and burning of bio-medical waste in the open adjacent to her residential block despite their objections.Another woman of the same block Kamlesh Verma alleged that the hospital authorities had been overlooking norms laid down for the disposal of bio-medical waste. “Apart from causing health problems, the presence of pigs and stray dogs at the dump is a sore to the eyes,” she said.Chief medical superintendent Dr RP Singh said, “A Bareilly-based waste treatment firm, Envirad Medicare Private Ltd, had been given the contract of collecting bio-medical waste from the hospital and dispose of the waste at their company’s plant. But, as their payment to the tune of Rs 12.65 lakh is outstanding due to money crunch, the company left in 2014.”“Now, we dump waste on the hospital campus, following the specifications issued for alternative arrangements for the disposal of bio medical waste,” he said. He, however, rejected the allegations that the hospital was dumping highly infectious waste in the open.Chief medical superintendent of district women hospital, which is also on the same campus, Dr Anita Chaurasia said Envirad worked till June 2015, after which no effort was made to renew the contract.Pilibhit chief medical officer Dr OP Singh said it was the duty of Envirad to submit bids for the disposal of bio waste management. “We have published tender two years back, but Envirad did not respond to it”.Envirad controller Rishi Kapoor, however, “The hospital owes our huge payment and despite several notices no heed was paid to the clearance of our outstanding amount. The treatment of bio waste is an essential service, which we intended to continue with in the national interest, but how long could we go without payments.”Over a question about quantum of daily production of bio medical waste in government hospitals, the additional chief medical officer, DR CM Chaturvedi, said that one indoor patient at hospital was estimated to produce 300 to 400 grams of bio medical waste a day while as per the CMS of women hospital, Dr Chaurasia, the amount of this waste was much more in her hospital due to delivery cases of babies.As per Chaurvedi, the district hospital had indoor capacity of 200 beds, the district women hospital had 70 beds while of the 7 community health centers at block level each was equipped with 30 beds, each of 22 additional primary health centers had 2 beds for admitting patients and one primary health center had 6 beds for indoor patients.A renowned private surgeon Dr Sailendra Gangwar and a pediatrician, Dr Deepak Kumar, told TOI that the dumping of bio waste could transmit infections of many serious diseases especially of blood born diseases like hepatitis B, C and HIV. The smoke caused by burning of this contagious waste could be a reason for many respiratory diseases of serious nature."

"‘After UP breach, it’s time Aadhaar database went through audit’",2017-09-12,NEW DELHI,,"NEW DELHI: Shocked by the breach of security of Aadhaar , the biometric ID project for India’s residents , as UP police on Monday arrested 10 men for “successfully” creating fake biometric identities by cloning fingerprints, a group of concerned citizens has raised the need for an independent audit of the database.UP Special Task Force caught the 10-member gang operating under the guise of certified Aadhaar operators. The men faked operators’ fingerprints using photopolymer resin and cracked open enrolment software of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).In a press release, the group of concerned citizens said news reports showed the criminal gang lifted fingerprints of operators sub-contracted by UIDAI, printing the fingerprints on butter paper. Additionally, they illegally used a software vulnerability to bypass the iris authentication check established by the government. Such a breach would allow anyone to send enrolment packets into the Central Identities Data Repository, where all biometrics and demographics data of Indian residents are stored.News reports showed the revenue model of this theft was based on selling kits of software and fingerprints at Rs 5,000 each. This allowed people to set up fake enrollment agencies and gather vast quantity of data.A report in the Indian Express indicated that police found 38 cloned fingerprints on paper, 46 cloned fingerprints made of a chemical, 12 mobile phones, two Aadhaar finger scanners, two retina scanners, eight rubber stamps and 18 Aadhaar cards. The investigation is on, and police say the scam might extend to other states too.Citizens have demanded that in the wake of this development, the government must immediately halt coerced enrolment into Aadhaar and linking of services to it. In January this year, the government claimed that 99% of all adults were enrolled in the Aadhaar database. The citizens opposing Aadhaar’s spread say all notices already issued under Section 7 of Aadhaar Act, mandating its use for essential services must be withdrawn, given this revelation that it is not foolproof. Only recently, the state of Rajasthan issued notifications making Aadhaar mandatory even for those availing treatment for silicosis, the incurable lung disease that affects stone quarry workers, and those battling HIV/AIDS.The press release said Aadhaar database must be subjected to an independent audit by a public agency, with representation from the public. People should be notified and suitably compensated when personal biometrics are compromised. Also, details of the breach that the UP STF is investigating should be put out in the public domain, so people have knowledge of the extent of the breach.UIDAI also owes an explanation to the standing committee on home affairs on all instances of such breaches, and attempts to prevent these. Also, action taken in such cases and whether those affected have been notified should be explained to the public.The government has consistently claimed that Aadhaar is foolproof. UIDAI says only authorized agents can enroll people; all enrolment must be validated by the operator’s fingerprint and iris scan, along with Aadhaar number. This breach shows unaudited and unverified enrolments entered the CIDR central database, and exposes as false claims of the government. The enrollment software was cracked open, but the news reports do not offer any insights on how precisely this was done.Experts warn that if a fingerprint can be faked on a high-resolution scanner used during enrolment, it can be faked on low resolution scanners used during authentication. “There is a continuous push to enroll along with a threat of cutting off citizens from essential services of food, cooking gas, pensions, scholarships, disability aid, and now the threat of cutting off access to bank services and mobile connections, unless they submit their biometrics and link every existing ID to the Aadhaar database,” the press release said, adding that it was worrying that residents of India have almost no legal remedies if their personal data is made insecure by UIDAI. The press release quotesSection 47(1) of Aadhaar Act: “No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under this Act, save on a complaint made by the Authority or any officer or person authorized by it.”Citizens say UIDAI is responsible for both maintaining the security and confidentiality of identity information and authentication records, as well as for approaching a court in case of a security breach – which is a conflict of interest. There is no provision in the law for residents to get mandatory notifications from UIDAI, if their data is breached.This is not the first time a breach was detected. In 2012, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited (IL&FS) staff enrolled 30,000 people fraudulently in Hyderabad. Students at a Mumbai technology institute recently demonstrated how easily a system that relies on biometrics can be fooled, by falsifying attendance through cloned fingerprints."
"Job or pension, widows of HIV men get a raw deal",2017-09-13,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News","CHENNAI: Nursing a woman she had never met before, Srilatha* sat on a motorized cart that took her away from her two children in Jagadevi village in Krishnagiri district. That was two months ago. The 33-year-old is bent on saving the stranger, even if it keep her from home for a long time. “This could be me some day. I want to believe there will be someone when my time comes,” said Srilatha, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2008.Srilatha is among a large section of HIV positive women widowed by the epidemic who have lost faith in the state. She cites the 37-year-old HIV positive woman she is helping as an example. “Her husband, a truck driver, died in 2003, leaving her with two children. She applied for government jobs but no one called her back after the interview,” said Srilatha who was asked to help the woman by a ‘positive network’ she is a part of. Since January the woman hasn’t received money she is entitled to under the Destitute Widow Pension Scheme. “Doctors at Salem said she has TB. She can barely get up now. The little life that is left in her is aching for her two children back home,” said Srilatha, who, when TOI called, was making arrangements to bring the woman to Chennai after doctors advised her to.From erratic pension to being turned down by the government while applying for jobs to navigating a corrupt system to make ends meet, several HIV positive women TOI spoke to narrated their travails of having to fend for themselves after losing their husbands.“The only jobs we have are in NGOs that work in the field of HIV/AIDs. Even this isn’t stable as it is mostly project-based. Once it is completed we are unemployed again,” said Kalpana*, 40, from Vellore, whose husband died in 2000. Kalpana hasn’t got her pension of Rs1,000 under the destitute widows’ scheme since January either. “When I went to the bank, they referred me to the taluk office. From there I was directed to the Collector’s office, only to be told that they hadn’t received funds,” she said. In March, when she was struck by encephalitis – an infection of the brain -- Kalpana had to depend on the largesse of other women in her peer group to meet her medical expense at a private hospital. When asked why she didn’t consult a government hospital, she said most people in her group prefer private hospitals to government ones. “The waiting time is too long. And the facilities in private hospitals are much better,” she said.Other women complained of being asked for bribes for government jobs. “And the price goes higher if they know you are HIV-positive,” said Vinitha*, a 38-year-old mother of two from Tiruchengode in Namakkal."
Hi-tech tests can cut blood transfusion risk,2017-09-17,KOCHI,"News,City News,Kochi News,Civic Issues","KOCHI: Concerned over the incident at the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC), where a child being treated for blood cancer tested positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus after a blood transfusion, experts have called for introduction of Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT), which can detect HIV , Hepatitis B and C, in at least one government facility in each zone in the state.Neighbouring Karnataka has set up a NAT lab where samples from all government hospitals are collected and rewports are emailed 247. The turn-around time from collection to reporting is less than a day .“It is disheartening to hear that hospitals like the RCC don't have NAT facility, which can detect viruses like HIV and various Hepatitis strains in its window period, said Dr Abraham Varghese, IMA blood bank officer, Kochi. IMA Kochi and a couple of private super-speciality hospitals in the state have installed NAT machines.NAT is advisable as conventional enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) cannot detect very early stages of infection of HIV , Hepatitis B and C, which have a `window period'.“The window period for HIV is usually between three weeks and three months. NAT is comparatively safe since it can reduce the window period to seven weeks,“ said Dr M Narayanan, paediatrician and president, IMA Kochi.IMA Kochi officials said that all the 13,000 blood samples in their blood bank were found safe in ELISA tests done in past five years. “But ever since we introduced the NAT testing facility , 12 blood samples were found infected with viruses like HIV and Hepatitis B, C in window period,“ said Dr Sunil Mathai, secretary of IMA blood bank, Kochi. Office bearers of the Kerala Blood Donors Forum , with more than one lakh donors and 3,000 direct members, say that some hospitals threaten patients if they don't bring blood donors. This leads to paid blood donations which could be unsafe. “Voluntary blood donation is the key to safe blood transfusion. At least a few government institutions across the state should have hitech testing facility,“ said Jishnu Raj , joint secretary .“There have been several instances when bystanders have called and offered to payall we had to do is to ensure blood donors. But we don't do it.We have a dedicated network of highly motivated individuals offering donation voluntarily ,“ Raj said.Unnikrishnan Panicker, former blood safety officer, Kerala, said attempts should be made to network all blood donors under the Kerala Blood Transfusion Council ( KBTC ). He said that a local area network and a state network can be created and any person volunteering for blood donation should be given a card, the credentials of which can be checked in any facility across the state.“Since the state has rules in place for blood donation, voluntary blood donation can become the accepted system,“ Panicker said.“We had proposed a model adopted by Karna taka government which introduced the centralised facility. We could replicate a similar system with one centre each at government medical colleges in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode and at the regional blood transfusion centre in Aluva. These centres could function as nodal points for checking blood safety,“ said Dr N Vijayakumar, medical officer in-charge.However, state government officials say need of the hour is to spread the message of voluntary donation among the population from 18 years to 65 years. “This will not just ensure safety but also keep donors healthy as their blood profile will be checked frequently .As of now only 60-65% of the blood donated comes from voluntary donors. The rest are from replacements. The state needs about 4-5 lakh units of blood annually,“ said Dr R Ramesh, project director, Kerala state AIDS control society (KSACS)."
"Tamil Nadu: TB kills most HIV-positive people, but Tamil Nadu has no clear count",2017-09-13,CHENNAI,"News,City News,Chennai News,Civic Issues","CHENNAI: The good: Tamil Nadu has halted and reversed the HIV/AIDS epidemic after being on the high prevalence map for seven years. The bad: More people living with the infection are dying now compared to previous years.Statistics sourced by TOI shows that 4,397 people infected with HIV died in 2016. While from 2009 to 2013, the average number of deaths every year has stood at around 2,192, from 2014 onwards, this has gone up to 3,744 – a 70% jump. The figures were shared by Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) after officials initially refused to share data to an RTI query on HIV-related deaths stating that the information is “highly sensitive”.While a section of officials attributed the increase to death of people who form the “backlog group” – those diagnosed as being HIV positive 10-15 years ago, another section said there has also been a substantial rise in the number of people reporting at an advanced stage, resulting in poor treatment outcome.A senior TANSACS official said the department did not have specifics on the cause of death among those infected with the virus. “Most of the time, the antiretroviral therapy centres get to know about the death of patients through outreach workers or other positive patients,” he said, adding the data available also included those who had died of reasons that were not directly linked to HIV, like suicide and accidents.TANSACS field officers say at least 60% of the deaths were because of opportunistic infections like tuberculosis – the biggest killer, followed by meningitis, pneumonia or diarrhea owing to lowered immunity level caused by HIV. “We need general physicians at ART centers to test for these infections. We lose at least 20% of our patients as they go directly to hospitals. They often don’t return to the ART centers after that,” said a field officer in Salem, among the high-risk districts. At present, ART medical officers only provide ART drugs and monitor the CD4 count – an important laboratory indicator of the immune function and the strongest predictor of HIV progression.According to the last India HIV Estimation report compiled by the National AIDS Control Organisation, Tamil Nadu has 1.43 lakh people living with HIV as on 2015. The number of new cases being detected have gone down over the years from 25,572 in 2009 to 11,345 in 2016.Another field officer in Trichy said almost 70% of the cases that come to the ART clinic at an advanced stages with a CD4 count of less than 250. “Late detection has always been a problem as AIDS is asymptomatic. People can live for 7-10 years without any symptoms. But we are seeing a marginal increase in these people,” he said, adding it could be because of the decline in awareness programmes. If detected late, death usually happens in the first six months since initiation of ART. The mortality rate, he said, is higher among males, aged 18 and above, among illiterates, and those residing in rural areas.Another section of officials said most of the deaths are among those diagnosed with AIDS a decade ago. “In early 2000 the average survival rate of those infected was around five years, but with the advancement of drugs and better intervention it is around 10-15 years. Those people who were diagnosed back then could be dying now,” said an official from Vellore, adding that the death would decline too with lesser new infections.Dr R R Gangakhedkar, direct-in charge of National AIDS Research Institute said the death rate was significantly high even if this included the ageing cohort. “This calls for further investigation to see if this increase is across the duration of antiretroviral therapy,” said Dr Gangakhedkar, adding that he also found it surprising that people were reporting with lower CD4 counts as the national average of the count among patients reporting in ART centers is on the rise.Some experts TOI spoke to also pointed out the discrepancy in numbers. “NACO report shows a 60% decrease in HIV-related deaths. The numbers keep differing in various platforms – it shows poor surveillance and data-keeping,” said Vijay Raman from Voluntary Health Services who undertake projects related to HIV/AIDS among the transgender community.Activists have also pinned the trend to lesser awareness programmes with many international donors pulling out of the state and the Centre cutting funds."
"Beware of unhygienic beauty parlours, dentists’ chambers",2017-09-16,Bengaluru,"News,City News,Bengaluru News","Bengaluru: Those going to beauty parlours for manicures and pedicures and dentists to fix teeth or gum problems need to watch out. Doctors have warned about hygiene issues in beauty parlours and usage of non-sterilized equipment by dentists.City doctors are seeing patients with no history of infection walking in with Hepatitis B and C (liver disorders) due to exposure to inadequately sterilized needles. They warned people to be wary about fish pedicures and foot spas where containers, often unchanged, result in them contracting these ailments.Dr BS Ravindra, chief consultant, gastroenterology department, BGS Global Hospital, said: “Women are more prone to develop hepatitis if proper measures and hygiene are not maintained while enjoying their manicure or pedicure . These viruses are transmitted through blood and Hepatitis B is 50-100 times more dangerous than HIV, while Hepatitis C is 10 times more deadly.”Contraction of hepatitis through manicure and pedicure is initially asymptomatic. “But they stay in the body for up to 25 years and then cause serious liver problems,” Dr Ravindra added.Patient-to-patient transmission of Hepatitis C, besides unhygienic use of needles and tools, occurring in dentists chambers is a matter of concern, say doctors.“The virus can be transmitted from one person to another based on contact. If any dentist has Hepatitis B, he can transmit it to the patient and vice-versa,” said Dr Dinesh Kini K, director, Institute of Digestive and Hepato-Pancreatico-Biliary (HPB) Sciences, Sakra World Hospital.Around 20% of adult patients Dr Kini treats for chronic hepatitis have contracted the infection due to improper sterilization of instruments used for manicure, pedicure and dental procedures.Dr Nikhil Bondade, consultant gastroenterologist and hepatologist, Narayana Health City, said: “Parlours and dentists should either use new instruments for every customer or sterilize instruments as per scientific protocols.”“The transmission can be avoided if proper hygiene training is conducted for all nail salon workers. All workers should be educated about how hepatitis and other blood-borne infections are transmitted,” added Dr N Arun Kumar, head of surgery, St. Martha’s Hospital."
Understanding the `window period',2017-09-17,THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,"News,City News,Thiruvananthapuram News,Civic Issues","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Every discussion that surrounds the unsafe blood transfusion incident which resulted in HIV infection at the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) is centred on the term `window period'.Regional Cancer Centre authorities, in a statement issued in response to the news said that a person who has freshly contracted with HIV may take four to 12 weeks for the virus to be detected. This time period is called window period.Even though the RCC do not deny or accept the allegation that the child was infected with the virus during the treatment here, they believe that chances are high that blood from someone, in the window period of HIV infection, might have been used for transfusion.The police team probing the case too have received a similar opinion from medical experts.Hence, they have already commenced measures to track down all the donors, whose blood components were used for treatment of the girl, and subject them for tests for HIV .The hospital statement suggested that the child had done blood tests at other hospitals and private labs and the infection could have been caused from a facility other than RCC.According to Dr Manoj Vellanad , a government doctor and executive member of Blood Donors Kerala , hospitals here employ first generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa), which is cheap.But, its drawback is that it would detect the antibodies that are at least 84 days old. Using third generation Elisa test can help bring down this win dow period 30-34 days.There are also other advaneced tests like P24 Assay, which can bring down the window peri od again to 15-20 days and Nucleic acid Amplification Test (NAT), which can detect the infection within seven to 15 days. “But, since these tests are comparatively costly, the hospitals here go for first generation Elisa tests,“ he said.“As per records of National Aids Control Society as many as 1,559 persons contracted HIV through blood donation in 2015-16. There has not been even a single such case reported in UK since 2005 and in US since 2008 because they upgraded to NAT. It is high time we too adopted such advanced tests,'' Dr Manoj Vellanad said."

The report by KSACS director Dr R Ramesh, however, also points out that RCC is not equipped to detect the virus during the window period ­ time from infection to a positive result.The Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS), which has given a clean chit to the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) authorities after a nine-year-old girl contracted HIV during the blood transfusion done at the Centre, has pointed out in its report that RCC is not equipped to detect the virus during the window period. The report prepared by KSACS director Dr R Ramesh said that the blood given to the nine-year-old kid was tested before the transfusion and it had not tested positive for HIV. “Always there is a two to three weeks window period to find whether it is HIV positive. Hence, in this case also, it has been found that the blood stored in the blood bank and all the samples collected there were properly tested. Hence the RCC authorities cannot be blamed,” said Dr Ramesh.However, he pointed out that the hospitals and blood banks in the state are not well equipped to detect the virus in the window period for which we will have to seek assistance from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). KSACS will soon be writing to NACO seeking more help in introducing the most advanced testing facilities here. In all government medical college hospitals and RCC we need such testing facilities, he added. In the fact finding mission of the KSACS, it has been found that about 49 times blood components were given to the kid and during each time the blood sample was tested.Hence the RCC authorities had taken all steps to ensure that the blood was safe. “We cannot blame the RCC for the facility they do not have,” said Ramesh. Meanwhile, the committee appointed by the state government, which is headed by joint director of medical education Dr Sreekumari, will submit its report to the government on Tuesday. The committee has completed collecting the details from the RCC and also the records of the blood samples stored in the blood bank. An internal committee was also formed by RCC director Dr Paul Sebastian. “The report is ready and we will be handing it over to the government on Tuesday,” said Dr Sebastian. However, he was not ready to divulge about the details of the report."
"After UP, Punjab recorded highest jail inmate deaths in India: NCRB",2017-09-19,CHANDIGARH,"News,City News,Chandigarh News,Crime","CHANDIGARH: Punjab has recorded the second highest number of deaths of jail inmates in the country , trailing only behind Uttar Pradesh (UP), as per the statistics of National Crime Record Bureau ( NCRB ) for the period 2012 to 2015.While as many as 1,358 prisoners lost their lives in jails across UP, 714 prisoners died in Punjab during the same period. Taking serious note of the lack of adequate facilities in 1,382 prisons across the country , the Supreme Court , on Friday , had ordered that the families of the jail inmates, who had died an unnatural death since 2012, should be compensated.The division bench comprising Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta had directed all the high courts across the country to take note of all unnatural deaths inside prisons since 2012 and to ensure award of adequate compensation to their nextof-kin.Prisoners die unnatural death by committing suicide, due to attack by jail inmates or because of the negligence of jail authorities.The NCRB's prison statistics available till 2015 reveal that there have been 551unnatural deaths between 2012 and 2015 in various jails of the country , including 43 unnatural deaths recorded in Punjab jails.As many as 27 unnatural prisoner deaths were recor ded in Haryana and four in Himachal Pradesh jails during that period. Punjab jails had recorded five unnatural deaths in 2015, 12 in 2014, nine in 2013 and 17 in 2012.Similarly , four jail inmates had died in Haryana jails in 2015, 10 in 2014, nine in 2013 and six in 2012. In case of HP, two unnatural deaths of jail inmates were reported in 2015 and one each in 2014 and 2012.No unnatural death of any prisoner was recorded in Chandigarh jail during this period.The Supreme Court had also observed on Friday that the states and union territories had not followed the directions given to them by the Na tional Human Rights Commission (NHRC), in true spirit. The court observed that this had led to continuance of unnatural deaths in jails.Statistics reveal that in 2015, highest number of 323 jail inmates had died in UP prisons followed by 178 in Punjab jails. However, there were a total number of 1,584 deaths in all the jails across the country in 2015 out of which 115 were unnatural deaths. Similarly , highest number of 321 jail inmates had died in UP jails in 2014 and the number of such deaths was 230 in Punjab jails. In 2014, as many as 195 unnatural deaths were recorded in jails across the country out of a total of 1,702 deaths.Meanwhile. responding to a question about reasons for large number of deaths in Punjab prisons, ADGP (prisons) I P S Sahota said, “Many jail inmates do not reveal that they are drug addicts or they are HIV positive patients, which later results in their deaths.“ He added that clear directions have been issued to the jail staff to find out such inmates and to provide them medical assistance rather than facing negligence charges."
HIV positive blood: Man jabbed syringe with HIV+ mother's blood into his wife,2017-09-20,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News,Crime News","MUMBAI: Probe into the recent case where a man allegedly injected a syringe into his 22-year-old pregnant wife’s back inside Bandra family court premises has revealed that the unidentified red liquid was his HIV-positive mother’s blood. Cops have booked the man’s sister, a nurse, for allegedly helping him extract their mother’s blood. After the incident, the two-month pregnant woman underwent an abortion.Bandra-Kurla Complex police arrested Abhimanyu Kamble (26) on September 6 for injecting the syringe into his wife’s back after an argument.Kamble and his wife Anita met in 2013 and got married a year later. Barely a year into the marriage, Kamble allegedly began to physically assault Anita. In 2016, Anita lodged a domestic violence complaint against Kamble at Tilak Nagar police station. However, even after the case was filed, things did not improve between them. She filed for divorce.On the day of the incident, the couple was present in court around 2pm, both with their respective relatives, when they got into an argument. A while later, Anita told her parents that she wanted to use the washroom. As she was walking towards it, she felt something pierce her back. She told cops that when she was pulling out the syringe, she was shocked to see her husband nearby, and pushed him. Apprehending trouble, Kamble fled.Kalpana Gadekar, senior inspector, BKC police station, confirmed the development. “We asked him whose blood was it and Kamble replied that it was extracted from his mother, who is an HIV patient. During interrogation, he told the police that his sister, who has done a nursing course and earlier worked in a Navi Mumbai hospital, had helped collect the blood. We have made her an accused in the case too,” said Gadekar. He was arrested, interrogated and released on bail.Police said they have learnt that in her complaint to Tilak Nagar police, Anita also alleged that Kamble would subject her to unnatural sex. “Kamble insisted that if she withdrew her complaint, he would agree to the divorce. She was therefore shocked over the syringe attack,” said an officer. Cops have sent the red liquid for chemical analysis to Kalina forensic science laboratory. She was sent for a medical examination. Cops have reportedly written to Bhabha Hospital, asking them to conduct an advanced test to find if the HIV-positive blood can pose a health risk."
HIV during blood transfusion: Kid's mother seeks probe by central govt,2017-09-23,KOCHI,"News,City News,Kochi News","KOCHI: Mother of a minor girl with leukaemia who was infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) allegedly after undergoing blood transfusion at Regional Cancer Centre ( RCC ), Thiruvananthapuram, has approached the Kerala high court seeking a probe by the central government.In a petition filed before the high court on Friday, the girl’s mother sought an order directing a probe by the secretary of ministry of health and family welfare as well as by the chief secretary of the state government.The petitioner alleged that the state government failed to take any action even after orders were issued by the state human rights commission and the child rights commission.In the petition, the mother points out that all bodily tests, including the one for HIV, were carried out at the time of admission to RCC on September 28 and the result was negative. After the blood transfusion from the blood bank of RCC, the girl was affected by HIV virus. This was confirmed by further tests done at RCC and various hospitals, the petition stated.“The patient admitted for cancer treatment became an HIV patient. The irresponsibility and culpable negligence of the hospital and authorities are in violation to the natural right and right to live, which was guaranteed under the Constitution of India. The state human rights commission and child rights commissions had suo motu intervened in the matter and directed for urgent actions. But nothing was done by the state government other than forming some inquiry committees as usual,” the petition said.The petitioner, along with seeking a court order for a probe by central government, has also demanded compensation, rehabilitation, and treatment for the victim. A probe must be conducted by the central government and the chief secretary of the state government against the erring officials and also whether similar incidents occurred during blood transfusion before at RCC and other hospitals. As an interim measure, the government must be directed to grant adequate financial aid to the victim, the petitioner has demanded.Reports by high-level team appointed by the state government, the Kerala AIDS Control Society and an internal probe held by the cancer centre had stated that RCC was not at fault.The report by the high-level team said there was no technical error on the part of the RCC. As per the report, the virus might have been transmitted through the blood which was transfused during the window period. A person who has freshly contracted HIV may take four to 12 weeks for the virus to be detected."

IMA blood bank moots common use of NAT,2017-10-08,KOCHI,"News,City News,Kochi News","KOCHI: The Indian Medical Association ( IMA )-Kochi Blood Bank has proposed to use its nucleic acid testing ( NAT ) facility by all private hospitals to check blood to prevent incidents like contamination during blood transfusion as had happened in the case of the child who is alleged to have got infected by HIV.At a recent meeting of private hospitals and blood banks held in the collectorate as part of the blood donation week, which concluded on Saturday, IMA blood bank officials requested the district administration to ask all private hospitals to use the facility at IMA blood bank.District collector Mohammed Y Safirullah, who chaired the meeting to discuss the issues of blood banks, said: “While hospitals can use the facility for ensuring safe blood transfusion , it is for the government to make NAT testing mandatory for all hospitals and blood banks.”“The state government will have to make a policy decision on this,” he said.“We need to encourage voluntary blood donation which will ensure safe blood and also keep the donors healthy too. We had screened 13,000 samples at our blood bank and all these samples were found safe in ELISA test. But when we did the NAT test, 12 blood samples were infected with viruses like HIV and hepatitis which were in window period,” said Dr Sunil Mathai, secretary of IMA blood bank.“NAT equipment is expensive and the infrastructure as well as investment costs won’t be affordable for most hospitals,” he said.“We are ready to help hospitals which cannot afford to buy NAT equipment. We are ready to screen blood samples at our laboratory using NAT. At present, we charge Rs 1,000 for one unit of blood for conducting NAT test,” Dr Sunil said. Meanwhile, the authorities at regional blood testing centre (RBTC) at Aluva have written to the state AIDS control society proposing to set up a NAT facility here.“We are the only NABH accredited blood bank in the state and have a blood transportation van and the funds to purchase additional vehicles for transport of blood components at the optimum temperature to any distance,” said Dr N Vijayakumar, chairman, IMA committee on blood banks.He said that RBTC Aluva can function as a centralized facility and no additional construction or personnel are required to start a NAT centre. The rates can be brought down.The RBTC, which is one of the central facilities meeting the demand for blood in rural areas, is set to introduce aphaeresis machine which will check wastage of blood.“With this machine, only platelets are collected and the rest of the blood goes back to the donor,” Dr Vijayakumar said.“We are facing a shortage of blood, especially platelets during dengue outbreaks. Over the past three months, RBTC could only meet 30% of the requirement from the government and private hospitals in the outskirts of the city. In the city, there was not much issue as many of the corporate and super specialty hospitals have their own facility,” he said."

The building was constructed with funds Malzner raised over the past five years from Austria to give a permanent residence to 40-odd children, who lost their parents to HIV/AIDS. These children have been living rented homes for the past 12 years and forced to shift at least 15 times.The birthday celebration was made special as the new building for the care home was inaugurated on the same day. “I will never forget this birthday,” Malzner told ToI.Malzner raised 60,000 Euros on her own and persuaded an organisation called Karibu World, which chipped in with 60,000 Euros for the care home. “I raised 60,000 Euros and Karibu World also contributed an equal amount. Since Karibu World receives funds from the Austrian government, we can say that the government too helped in the construction of the building,” she said.It was a challenging task for Malzner to raise funds in her country. “I faced problems initially. But then I showed them my presentation, why I was doing it and they developed trust in me,” said Malzner.Malzner has a restaurant and also a shop in Hirschbach Im Mühlkreis, Oberosterreich, Austria. She also had many friends in the restaurant business. On her request, they agreed to donate amounts ranging from one Euro to five Euros per soup sold at theier establishments to Malzner.“I also sold scarfs in Austria which I took from India. The margin I got was donated to for the cause. I also organised parties, including dance events and food festivals, and asked participants to contribute,” Malzner said.She had first come to Jaipur in 2013 as a volunteer with an organisation to teach English to children in Katputli Nagar. “I came here in 2013 to do some community work for four weeks. It was not my aim to construct a building for such children. But, after spending four weeks in Kotpulti Nagar , I wanted to do more good work. So, I decided to work for these children,” said Malzner said, dressed in an Indian saree.“The child welfare committee (CWC) has inspected the house and given permission for shifting the children,” said CWC member Nisha Pareek.The children are being taken care of by the NGO, Aashray Care Home. “Our organisation was registered in 2006. Since then, we had to shift from at least 15 homes. It was difficult for us to get homes on rent for HIV children,” said, Sushila Mordiya , superintendent Aashray Care Home."

RCC not equipped to detect HIV during window period,2017-09-18,Thiruvananthapuram,"News,City News,Thiruvananthapuram News","Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS), which has given a clean chit to the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) authorities after a nine-year-old girl contracted HIV during the blood transfusion done at the Centre, has pointed out in its report that RCC is not equipped to detect the virus during the window period.The report prepared by KSACS director Dr R Ramesh said that the blood given to the nine-year-old kid was tested before the transfusion and it had not tested positive for HIV.“Always there is a two to three weeks window period to find whether it is HIV positive. Hence, in this case also, it has been found that the blood stored in the blood bank and all the samples collected there were properly tested. Hence the RCC authorities cannot be blamed,” said Dr Ramesh.However, he pointed out that the hospitals and blood banks in the state are not well equipped to detect the virus in the window period for which we will have to seek assistance from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). KSACS will soon be writing to NACO seeking more help in introducing the most advanced testing facilities here. In all government medical college hospitals and RCC we need such testing facilities, he added.In the fact finding mission of the KSACS, it has been found that about 49 times blood components were given to the kid and during each time the blood sample was tested. Hence the RCC authorities had taken all steps to ensure that the blood was safe. “We cannot blame the RCC for the facility they do not have,” said Ramesh.Meanwhile, the committee appointed by the state government, which is headed by joint director of medical education Dr Sreekumari, will submit its report to the government on Tuesday. The committee has completed collecting the details from the RCC and also the records of the blood samples stored in the blood bank.An internal committee was also formed by RCC director Dr Paul Sebastian. “The report is ready and we will be handing it over to the government on Tuesday,” said Dr Sebastian. However, he was not ready to divulge about the details of the report."
Rap for blood banks over negligence with HIV+ donors,2017-10-10,MUMBAI,"News,City News,Mumbai News","MUMBAI: Several blood banks in the city may be faltering in one of their basic, yet crucial, responsibilities, which is to refer donors to HIV/AIDS clinics if they are found to be infected with the virus.It was recently found that while 489 units of blood were found to be HIV positive in 2016-17, only 230 donors were subsequently referred to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC).Failure of blood banks to link HIV-infected patients with ICTC centres—where the infection is confirmed and further management of the disease facilitated— could not just lead to the individual going without antiretroviral therapy, but also infecting others inadvertently.At a review meeting held by the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) in July, the findings were discussed with blood banks, who have now been asked to be more diligent in linking donors.HIV positivity in the city in 2016-17 was found to be 0.3%, which is lower than the national average of 0.136%. While the overall HIV positivity in blood units collected in the city has been decreasing, it seems that the infection rate at the National AIDS Control Organisation-supported blood banks has remained stagnant for the last four years. An average of 480 units of HIV-infected blood is detected every year. Interestingly, HIV positivity in non-NACO blood banks has been showing a steady decrease.A third of the 61 blood banks in Mumbai are supported by NACO and most of these are in public hospitals.Dr Shrikala Acharya, assistant project director of MDACS, said as per National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) guidelines blood banks should collect information about donors in case they need to be contacted for counselling or treatment in the event of their reports indicating positive for an infection. “It’s a part of the pre-donor counselling that is supposed to be done before blood collection. It is not mandatory, but it is a part of the guidelines,” she said.Acharya added, “Often blood units are collected through camps, where a person may or may not have given his contact details. This is why we are strengthening referral systems.”"
